40,"Antal, Frederick",21 December 1887,"Budapest, Czechoslovakia; [present day Czech Rebuplic]",4-Apr-54,"London, England, UK","Marxist/social-history art historian. Antal was born to a wealthy Jewish family. His father, Alajos Antal, was a medical doctor and his mother was Sofia Gerstl. The younger Antal completed a law degree in Budapest and then continued there as well as Freiburg and Paris to study art history. In studied in Berlin under <a href=""/wolfflinh"">Heinrich WĚ¦lfflin</a> and then in Vienna under <a href=""/dvorakm"">Max DvorĚÁk</a>. He received his doctorate in art history in 1914 writing his thesis under Dvo�ŞĚÁk on neoclassical and Romantic French painting. Antal volunteered in the Print Collection at the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest (1914/1915) cataloging the prints and drawings with <a href=""/wildej"">Johannes Wilde</a>. In 1916 he joined the illustrious discussion group the <em>Sonntagskreis</em>, whose members included intellectuals such as the philosopher Georg LukĚÁcs (1885-1971), the sociologist Karl Mannheim (1893-1947) and art historians <a href=""/hausera"">Arnold Hauser</a> and Wilde. As World War I progressed, the Austro-Hungarian government, under whom he served, assigned him to Udine, Italy, to curate the art in this occupied territory. After the fall of the Empire, and the creation of the Hungarian Soviet Republic (March 21, 1919), Antal became <i>Vorsitzender des Direktoriums</i> (Chairman of the Board) at the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest, where he assisted in opening the museum's private collection to the public and organizing a successful exhibition with the help of museum director <a href=""/benescho"">Otto Benesch</a>. As <i>Vorsitzender</i> of the museum, Antal headed efforts to promote artists and protect national monuments. His tenure ended abruptly after the Counterrevolution of summer 1919, which forced him to flee first to Florence and then to Vienna. Partially funded by the University of Berlin, Antal traveled extensively in Italy between 1919 and 1923, spending most of his time in Florence. He completed his magnum opus, a history of sixteenth-century Florentine painting in the 1920s, but declined to publish it. He had, in the meantime, become enamored with a Marxist dialectical theory of history, but also, with the realization that any writing about late Italian painting (""Mannerism"") depended upon a thorough understanding to the fifteenth-century revolution which was the early Renaissance (Blunt). He married Theodora von Lobell (later divorced). The years 1923 to 1933 Antal spent as a resident of Berlin, where he collaborated with Bruno FĚ_rst (1891-1965) as editor (1926-1934) of the periodical <u>Kritische Berichte zur kunstgeschichtlichen Literatur</u>, a publication primarily concerned with methodology. In Berlin his interest was primarily on Italian sixteenth-century painting. In 1932 Antal toured Soviet museums, about which he later lectured (published 1976). The rise of the Nazi regime in Germany in 1933 forced him, as a Jew, to flee again, this time to England, where he was befriended by the art historian <a href=""/blunta"">Anthony Blunt</a>. In 1936 he remarried, now to Evelyn Foster (b. 1903/4), a British citizen, and Oxford graduate. Antal spent his first years in England rewriting his Florentine art history to incorporate his earlier findings and social-history approached. He lectured at the Courtauld Institute and became a naturalized citizen in 1946. Finally, in 1948, his reworked text was published as the book <u>Florentine Painting and its Social Background: the Bourgeois Republic before Cosimo de Medici's Advent to Power: Fourteenth and Early Fifteenth Centuries</u> in England. His research on drawing at the Royal Library at Windsor Castle, were incorporated into the 1949 catalog by <a href=""/pophama"">A. E. Popham</a> and Wilde. The same year he published ""Remarks on the Method of Art History"" his new-found credo on art-historical method. Thereafter, Antal's interests shifted from French classical/romantic painting to the 18th-century British artists Hogarth and FĚ_ssli. He died at his Marlborough Place home in 1954. His manuscripts on Hogarth and FĚ_ssli were published posthumously. His collected essays, <u>Classicism and Romanticism, with other Studies in Art History</u>, published 1966, contained some of his best writing, articles.  Antal's methodology can be seen as blending that of <a href=""/warburga"">Aby Warburg</a> with a more traditional Marxist view of art. In his later writings, he increasingly applied the concept of Marxist dialectical materialism to art history. He suggested that the concept of artistic style is primarily an expression of ideology, political beliefs and social class. This methodology has been criticized as assuming too strong a determination of artistic style by social constructs. Antal was also criticized for defining an artist's identity too narrowly by his patron or benefactor's social class and thereby neglecting the artist's subjectivity. The review of <u>Florentine Painting</u> by <a href=""/meissm"">Millard Meiss</a> in the <u>Art Bulletin</u> (1949) is most illuminating, both toward Antal's methodology and of the art establishment's reaction of his work. Antal's Marxist beliefs and reputation as politically a Communist effectively excluded from the Western academic world after 1948. His books following <u>Florentine Painting</u> were less imbued with this methodology. After his death, his social-history Marxist style became more popular and appreciated. The critic and art historian <a href=""/bergerj"">John Berger</a> cited Antal as a major influence on Berger's work and the medievalist <a href=""/grodeckil"">Louis Grodecki</a> in the 1970s acknowledged Antal's important study on competing Florentine monastic orders in architectural commissions. Blunt ascribed to Antal one of the earliest art historians to clearly define the term ""Mannerism"" and particularly FĚ_ssli's relationship to the earlier movement.",Hungary;UK,"Berger, John.

52,"Arnheim, Rudolf",1904,"Berlin, Germany",2007,"Ann Arbor, MI, USA","Philosopher of perception and art; used Gestalt psychology for his art-historical studies. Arnheim was the son of Georg Arnheim (1867-1944), a piano factory owner, and Betty Gutherz (Arnheim) (1879-1966). He was raised in Berlin, attending the Herdergymnasium (Abitur 1923). His parents intended him to assume the family business, but beginning in 1923 Arnheim, studied art and music history, philosophy and psychology at the University of Berlin with Gestalt-based scholars Wolfgang KĚ¦hler (1887-1967) and Kurt Lewin (1890-1947). His Ph.D. dissertation was supervised by the eminent theorist Max Wertheimer (1880-1943) in 1928. Arnheim became friends and was greatly influenced by the private art historian Kurt Badt (q.v.); his sister, Helen ""Leni"" Arnheim (1906-1973) married Badt. Arnheim pursued his interests in the arts through the editorship of <u>Die Weltbuhne</u>, a leftist magazine of politics and culture, publishing articles on film, art and architecture. This led him to develop his theories of the primacy of perception in art appreciation, linking it with the heretofore separated function of mental cognition. His investigations included music and film (he was one of the first to publish a book on the artistic aspects of the silent film in 1932). He married Annette Siecke (later divorced). While interviewing the Nazi filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl (1902-2003) on the radio, she prophetically warned him, ""As long as the Jews are film critics, I'll never have a success."" Hitler's rise in Germany meant Arnheim had to flee Jewish persecution, initially to Rome. He spent five years as associate editor for a League of Nations cultural publication before Mussolini allied himself with Hitler and Arnheim again had to move. He traveled to England working as a translator for the BBC. In 1940 he immigrated to the United States. He lectured at the New School for Social Research (influencing, among others, the first American Africanist <a href=""/sieberr"">Roy Sieber</a>) and then Columbia University, working as a researcher involved with the habits of radio listeners. Arnheim was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for the 1942-1943 year. He began teaching at Sarah Lawrence College in 1943, becoming a naturalized citizen in 1946. Arnheim married a second time to Mary Frame (1918-1999), a librarian, in 1953. He published his best known work, <u>Art and Visual Perception</u>, a theory of graphic understanding, in 1954. In 1962, Arnheim wrote a work of true art history, <u>Picasso's Guernica: The Genesis of a Painting</u>. In it, he traces the elements of the famous Picasso work and how they combine to create the meaning generally accepted today. Arnheim was appointed to Harvard University, Carpenter Center of Visual Arts, in 1968. He retired from Harvard in 1974, emeritus professor of the psychology of art. He continued as a visiting professor at the University of Michigan retiring a second time in 1984. At age 102 he contracted pneumonia at his Ann Arbor retirement community and died. Methodologically, Arnheim was fascinated by the perceptual structures in appreciating art. His investigations in the preliminary sketches for Picasso's Guernica, among other works, helped establish a revised view of art interpretation for many art historians. His pioneering notion of ""Visual thinking,"" the idea that vision itself is the primary modality for thought, is the driving force behind his books. His views on art harken to the empiricist philosophy of John Locke (1632-1704), who asserted that knowledge of the world is an objective sensory experience. Arnheim's view was criticized by, among others, the literary philosopher Richard Rorty (1931-2007) (who ironically died the day before Arnheim).",Germany;USA,"Kleinbauer, W.

73,"Badt, Kurt",1890,"Berlin, Germany",1973,"ĚĎberlingen am Bodensee, Germany","Private scholar; art historian of the baroque and modern periods; methodological theorist. Badt was born to a prosperous Banking family in Berlin. His father, Leopold Badt (1858-1929) raised his children in a rarefied cultural atmosphere, giving them every opportunity to experience art. The younger Badt attended the Berlin-Charlottenburg Reformgymnasium, graduating in 1906. Between 1909-1914 he studied art history and philosophy at the universities of Berlin, Munich and finally at Freiburg (im Breisgau) under <a href=""/vogew"">Wilhelm VĚ¦ge</a>. While a student, Badt took a young <a href=""/panofskye"">Erwin Panofsky</a> to hear a lecture by VĚ¦ge and thus cementing one of the most famous pupil/teacher relationships in art history. Badt's doctoral thesis, written in 1914, was on the Renaissance painter Andrea Solario. He never wrote a <i>habilitation</i> or taught professionally until nearly his retirement. Badt began his career as an assistant at the Bremen Kunsthalle, studying studio painting and sculpture. Throughout his career, his art-historical writing always reflected a painter's interest in details and their relationship to the world. He married Ella C. Wollheim around this time. Badt taught privately at Ludwigshafen/Bodensee, lecturing on the philosophy of G. F. W. Hegel (1770-1831), Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951), Wilhelm Dilthey (1833-1911) and Martin Heidegger (1889-1976), the latter whom he knew personally. His early writings in the 1920s included contemporary artists, such as Wilhelm Lehmbruck. His first marriage dissolved, Badt married Helen ""Leni"" Arnheim (1906-1973), the sister of the esthetician and art historian <a href=""/arnheimr"">Rudolf Arnheim</a>. With the ascension of the Hitler's party in Germany in 1933, Badt moved to Munich in anonymity to avoid Nazi persecution. Although a declared Roman Catholic, Badt's Jewish heritage eventually forced him to flee Nazi Germany at the outbreak of World War II in 1939. He gained a research position at the newly founded Warburg Institute in London, remaining there until after the war. In 1946 he published <u>EugĚ¬ne Delacroix Drawings</u>, his first book since the partial publication of his thesis in 1914. Badt returned to Germany in 1950 and became a German citizen in 1952, assisting with the reorganization of the university system. The post-war German period of his life resulted in his greatest publishing output. In 1961 Badt issued a series of essays (some previously published) on Jan Vermeer which outlined Badt's methodology '<u>Modell und Maler' von Vermeer</u>, but also pointedly criticizing the methodology of 'second Vienna school' art historian <a href=""/sedlmayrh"">Hans Sedlmayr</a>. Sedlmayr, perhaps staunchest supporter of Nazism to retain an art history professorship after World War II, argued for a pseudo-scientific theoretic approach to art. Ever rooted in the object, Badt's <u>Vermeer</u> attacked Sedlmayr on methodological grounds. In 1968 he was invited by literary theorist Hans Robert Jauss (1921-1997) to the newly founded University of Constance (Konstanz). Badt's work greatly influenced the art historians Gertrude Berthold (b. 1920), the Sedlmayr student <a href=""/dittmannl"">Lorenz Dittmann</a>, <a href=""/gosebruchm"">Martin Gosebruch</a>, <a href=""/grossw"">Werner Gross</a>, <a href=""/schmollj"">Josef Adolf Schmoll <em>genannt</em> Eisenwerth </a>and <a href=""/imdahlm"">Max Imdahl</a>. Despondent in old age, Badt committed suicide at 83. Badt regarded art as a portrait of reality (<i>Wirklichkeitsdarstellung)</i>. Of particular interest to him was the subject matter of the work and meaning of colors in paintings. This method lent itself best to the artists he studied: Nicolas Poussin, Jan Vermeer, John Constable, EugĚ¬ne Delacroix, Paul CĚ©zanne, Vincent van Gogh and Paolo Veronese. Badt considered the ""masterpiece"" to be the only art worth studying. Among his appreciators, Jauss, (1975) praised him for mentioning human suffering in his works, often forgotten by other historical works. W. Eugene Kleinbauer characterized him as ""too rigid for analysis."" Badt's art history owes much to Johann Gustav Droysen's <u>  Historik</u> (1868). Badt wrote about the distinction between art history and its political, social and economic implications. He questioned deeply rooted principles of art history as had Heinrich WĚ¦lfflin (q.v). Since he was writing against the norm, other art historians often portrayed as a traitor and his understanding of art was questioned. His writings and methodology sparked greatest interest in fields outside art history.",Germany,"Panofsky, Erwin.

Baum studied art history at the universities of Munich, Berlin and TĚ_bingen, where he worked under Karl Voll (q.v.) and Heinrich WĚ¦lfflin (q.v). He completed his dissertation in TĚ_bingen in 1905 on the churches of the architect Heinrich Schickhardt (1558-1634) under Konrad Lange (q.v.). Baum wrote his habilitation under Heinrich WeizsĚ_cker (q.v.) in Technische Hochschule in Stuttgart. In 1911 his work on <u>Ulmer Plastik um 1500</u>, caught the attention of the scholars Paul Clemen (q.v), Jakob Ritter von Falke (q.v) and Philipp Halm (1854-1923) at the Technische Hochschule. He taught art history there until 1924. Except for voluntary service in World War I, Baum worked between 1908-23 first as an assistant and then conservator at the Wurtemberg Office for Historic Conservation (WĚ_rttembergischen Amt fĚ_r Denkmalpflege) and at the state museum in Stuttgart. Out of this work he published the catalog <u>Deutschen Bildwerke des 10.-18. Jahrhunderts</u> (1931). In 1924 Baum was called to be the director of the museum at Ulm. There he dedicated himself to the history of local art and artists. He married Emma Gruner (1893-1970), a protestant woman, in 1929. In 1930 he published the final volume in the series of <u>Handbuchs des Kunstwissenschaft,</u> which was the first survey of the history of paintings and sculpture of the north Alps in the Middle Ages. After his dismissal in 1933 he was invited by Johnny Roosval (q.v.) of the University of Stockholm to lecture in the Winter semester of 1935. His lectures were published in 1937 in Paris as <u>La sculpture figurale en Europe ĚĘ l'Ě©poque mĚ©rovingienne</u>. Back in Stuttgart as a private art historian, Baum was arrested by the Gestapo in 1938 as a Jew and taken to the concentration camp at Welzheim. Authorities at a museum in Bern rescued him in 1939, enabling a move to Switzerland. He lived in Switzerland until the end of World War II working for the state archive in Lucerne researching medieval sculptors. In 1946 Baum returned to Germany at the invitation of the minister of culture Theodor Heuss (1884-1963). Baum was enlisted in the rebuilding of German castles between 1947-1952.  In his research on medieval Bavarian art, Bauch analyzed the development of styles and iconography of the Middle Ages. Baum understood style questions as matters of time, dissociated from at the trend toward a ""scientific approach to art"" which became vogue in the 1920s (led by Kurt Gerstenberg (q.v), Wilhelm Pinder (q.v), Oskar Hagen (q.v), Eugen Kurt Fischer) which related artistic epochs to among other things, ethnic peoples. Chief among these in the speculation was the gothic, which Baum regarded as an element of the era, not of a people. Typical of the form-analytic generation of art historians, Baum, saw the development of art in the context of the culture and history of ideas, a notion he adopted from Jakob Burckhardt (q.v.). In <u>ZwĚ¦lf deutsche Dome des Mittelalters</u><i> </i>(1955) he examined individual buildings and their sculptural decoration in the context of their respective social conditions in the cities and dioceses. The self-sufficiency of the German buildings were stressed, contrasting French and Italian reliance on the antique. The wall treatment became a key notion for Baum.

Among the elder Benesch's friends was the Austrian Expressionist Egon Schiele. A double portrait of father and son, painted by Schiele in 1913, is owned by the Wolfgang-Gurlitt-Museum in Linz, Austria. The younger Benesch studied art history at the University of Vienna and a semester in Stockholm under Johnny Roosval (q.v.). Around 1919 he assisted Friedrick Antal (q.v.) in organizing the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest. Benesch wrote his dissertation in Vienna under Max Dvo�ŞĚÁk in 1921 on the subject of Rembrandt's drawings. Between 1919-23 he was a volunteer assistant at the picture gallery (GemĚ_ldegalerie) at the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, under director of Gustav GlĚ_ck (q.v.). In 1923 he was appointed assistant curator at the Graphische Sammlung Albertina. There he met Eva Steiner, an administrative clerk, and married her in 1934. In 1935 he wrote the twelve-page (!) entry on Rembrandt for the <u>Allgemeines Lexikon der bildenden KĚ_nstler</u> (Thieme-Becker). With the annexation of Austria by the Nazis in 1938, the Benesches fled (Eva, although protestant, was of Jewish extraction). Traveling by way of Switzerland, Benesch moved to France and then, in 1939, was a guest lecturer in the Netherlands. The academic year 1939-40 he spent in England, where he was briefly interned on the Isle of Man at the outbreak of World War II. At the invitation of Walter W. S. Cook (q.v.), Benesch lectured at New York University, and in 1941 at Harvard University with the assistance of a Guggenheim Fellowship supplied by Wilhelm Koehler (q.v.). During the war he and Eva worked for the American Defense, Harvard Group, identifying art monuments in Austria and Czechoslovakia. In 1945 he was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. It was in 1945 that he first published his <u>The Art of the Renaissance in Northern Europe</u>. The book owes much to Dvo�ŞĚÁk, especially the expansion of the Dvo�ŞĚÁkian concept of Mannerism to northern artists such as Bruegel (Posner). In 1946 he was called back to Vienna, where he assumed the Director of the Albertina in 1947, a position he held until 1962. He was named Associate Professor of Art History at the University of Vienna in 1948. His years as director focused on acquisitions that broadened the scope of the Albertina's collections. Between 1954-57 Benesch published the first complete catalog of Rembrandt drawings, based on much original research. Benesch's area of scholarship was graphic arts and particularly Rembrandt.  His publications reflect his wide interests, covering gothic art, conservation of monuments, art theory and musicology (he was an organist and keyboard musician). Methodologically, Benesch was not wedded to theory, such as fellow Vienna-school historians Otto PĚ_cht (q.v.), Dagobert Frey (q.v.) and Hans Sedlmayr (q.v.). Instead, he employed the <i>Geistesgeschichte</i> approach of documentary/intellectual history akin to the work of his mentor Dvo�ŞĚÁk. He and Hans Tietze (q.v.) were among Dvo�ŞĚÁk's most important pupils. ",Austria,"Kleinbauer, W. Eugene. <u>Research Guide to the History of Western Art</u>.

Berger studied art history under Heinrich WĚ¦lfflin (q.v.), Adolph Goldschmidt (q.v.), Graf Vitzthum von EckstĚ_dt (q.v.) and Paul Frankl (q.v.) at the respective universities of Munich, Berlin, Heidelberg and GĚ¦ttingen. He completed his dissertation under Moritz Geiger in aesthetics at GĚ¦ttingen in 1925, his topic addressing WĚ¦lfflin's methodology. From 1926-28 was an assistant and one of the earliest collaborators at the Warburg Library in Hamburg, under Fritz Saxl (q.v.). He was a lecturer on art at the University of Berlin Extension, Berlin, between 1927-33 and head librarian at the Berlin Municipal Libraries, Berlin, 1929-1933. With the advent of the Nazi party's authority in 1933, Berger was forced to flee Germany, not because of religion (he was from a protestant family) but because of his profile in the Social Democratic party. He went first to France were he worked as a library assistant at the BibliothĚ¬que Nationale, lecturing on art (1936-1939) at an independent German-speaking school there. Just before the Nazi invasion of France, he secured an emergency visa to the United States, emigrating in 1941. He taught at Northwestern University as a lecturer on art, 1943-1945. As the war was winding down in Europe, Berger joined the U.S. Army University and returned to France at Biarritz, as a professor of art in 1945. He switched to the U.S. Military Government of Bavaria (OMGUS), where, as an officer, he worked in the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives Section for 1946. After war service he joined the University of Kansas City (now the University of Missouri at Kansas City), as an assistant professor of art (1947-1950) moving to the University of Kansas, Lawrence in 1950 as an assistant professor, eventually rising to professor of art history. He retired in 1970 and resettled in France.Berger's 1952 book on GĚ©ricault, the first modern biography of the artist, demonstrates Berger's methodology as an art historian. Downplaying the dominant view of GĚ©ricault as motivated by the Romantic movement, Berger emphasized the artist's political commitment. His quasi-Marxist approach, one reviewer remarked, follows that of Frederick Antal (q.v.). Indeed, Berger's brother was a prominent communist in pre-war Germany. Berger's interest was on reinterpreting the artist, rather than a discovery of new documents. The popularity of his approach--Berger employed Freudian analysis for a number of pictures--is demonstrated by the book's rapid translation into both French and English. However, Berger's emphasis on reinterpretation was at the cost of scrutiny of the original work. In a caustic reply to the Germain Seligman (q.v.) review of Berger's book in the <u>Art Bulletin</u>, Lorenz Eitner (q.v.) took Berger to task for accepting works as autograph which even then were suspect. The fact that Berger validated a painting in Seligman's gallery only added to the apparent impropriety.",Germany;USA,"Ulrike Wendland, <u> Biographisches Handbuch deutschsprachiger Kunsthistoriker im Exil: Leben und Werk der unter dem Nationalsozialismus verfolgten und vertriebenen Wissenschaftler.

Berliner's parents were Theodor Berliner, a protestant from Jewish extraction, who owned a factory, and Philippine Wollner (Berliner). Beginning in 1904, Berliner studied art history in Berlin, Heidelberg and Vienna under <a href=""/dvorakm"">Max Dvo�ŞĚÁk</a>, earning his doctorate in 1910 with a dissertation on the dating of a Greek manuscript miniature painting. He joined the Bavarian National Museum (Bayerischen Nationalmuseum) in Munich in 1912, working there until 1935 except for War service (1914-1918). He was chief curator at the museum from 1926. In 1933 Berliner, because of his Jewish heritage, was interned in the concentration camp in Dachau, but released after two years later through the initiative of two of his colleagues, the art historian Hans Buchheit (1878-?) and collector Eugen BrĚ_schwiler. He was nonetheless dismissed from the Museum on ""racial"" grounds, accusations of which he had previously escaped during the initial 1933 purge because of his extensive war service. Between 1935-1939, he lived in the Alps near Berchtesgaden, until he was finally forced to emigrate. In the United States, Berliner worked at the Museum of Arts of Decoration of Cooper Union (1939-1946), the Rhode Island School of Design Museum of Fine Arts (1946-1953), and at the Textile Museum in Washington DC from 1962 until his re-emigration to Germany in 1967. In the 1950s, Berliner taught the museum course at NYU's Institute of Fine Arts. Berliner was an authority on textile arts and ivory but also wrote on Christian iconography (notably representations of creches) and the 18th century Giuseppe Barberi (1746-1809). <a href=""/ettinghausenr"">Richard Ettinghausen</a>, in his introduction to Berliner's bibliography, notes that Berliner did not limit himself to ""great"" topics of art history but rather concerned himself with facts, fighting all superficial interpretation, turning his attention to the marginal and to everyday objects often considered only <i>curiosa</i> by established art historians.

Bernheimer was born into a prominent family of art dealers, <i>Bernheimer of Munich</i>. In the early 20th century, the firm was one of the most important dealerships in precious materials, antiquities, Gobelins and oriental carpets. Between 1925-30, Bernheimer studied art history (both Western and Oriental) as well as archeology in Munich, Berlin and Rome with Wilhelm Pinder (q.v.), Adolph Goldschmidt (q.v.), August Liebmann Mayer (q.v.), Hans Kauffmann (q.v.), Werner Weisbach (q.v.) and Hans Hildebrandt (q.v.). His dissertation, written under Pinder, was on Roman animal sculpture and its originating motives. Between the time of graduation and the Nazi assumption of power in 1933, he apparently taught privately and worked in the family business. Of Jewish extraction, Bernheimer was forced to flee Germany in 1933, securing a position at The University of Pennsylvania teaching undergraduates. Between 1933 and 1958 was respectively lecturer, Assistant Professor, and Associate Professor (1942) at Bryn Mawr and Haverford Colleges, also serving in the US army during the World War II. In 1951 he was appointed full professor. He spent the year 1941 at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He committed suicide in Portugal at age 50. His son, Charles Bernheimer (1942-1998), was a noted scholar of Comparative Literature and Multicultural Studies at the University of Pennsylvania. Bernheimer's life interest was in Oriental influences on the west, but his publications were wide ranging. His most important book, <u>Wild Men in  the Middle Ages</u> (1952), reflects his willingness to delve deeply into folklore and history to write a highly original and respected book. Known as well for an interest in mathematics, music and theology, <u>Wild Men</u> looked at fertility rites involving the staged capture of ""wild men"" in medieval Europe. His research allowed him to come up with compelling interpretations of beasts in medieval and reniassance art that had puzzled other scholars such as Erwin Panofsky (q.v.).

Bier grew up in a wealthy Nuremberg family. He attended the Humanistisches Gymnasium in that city. After graduation in 1917, he fought in the first World War 1917-18. Between 1919 and 1924 Bier studied art history, archaeology, and medieval and modern history at the universities in Munich, Erlangen, Jena, Bonn and finally ZĚ_rich. His major professors were Paul Clemen (q.v.) and Heinrich WĚ¦lfflin (q.v.). His dissertation, written under WĚ¦lfflin, was on the early work of his home town's most famous artist, Tilman Riemenschneider. It was granted in 1924 and published the following year. Between 1924-1930 Bier he began publishing his magisterial book on Riemenschneider while lecturing (Dozent) at the Volkschule. He also contributed articles on modern architecture. In 1931 he married the art historian Senta Dietzel (1900-1978), whose brother was the gallery owner Max Dietzel, a sponsor of the KĚ_nstlergruppe BrĚ_cke shows and other modern art. From 1930-36 Bier was a curator of the Kestner Society and Museum in Hannover which mounted contemporary art exhibitions. Bier himself collected the work of Bauhaus artists Paul Klee, Oskar Schlemmer and Lyonel Feininger. In 1936 the Nazi government closed the Kestner Society and banished Bier, who was Jewish. Bier withdrew first to upper Bavaria and then, in 1937 immigrated to the United States. His former classmate, Richard Krautheimer (q.v.) recommended Bier for the position he was vacating at the University of Louisville, Kentucky. Bier taught art history there 1937-60, acting as Chair of the department 1946-60. While Chair at Louisville, he founded the Allen R. Hite Institute.

He supplied over two hundred pieces of art criticism for the Louisville <u>Courier Journal</u>. In 1960, Bier was appointed to be the second director of the state art museum in North Carolina, replacing the late Wilhelm Valentiner (q.v.). He functioned as director of the North Carolina Museum of art until his retirement in 1970. His papers are housed at the University of Louisville where an endowed chair is named for him. Bier was a connoisseur-scholar who's research focused principally on gothic and renaissance architecture and sculpture.

After attending the Lyceum in Hamburg, 1909-1913 and receiving an <i>abitur</i> from the Heinrich-Hertz Realgymnasium in 1916, she attended the universities of Munich and then Hamburg concentrating in philosophy. Her dissertation, written under Ernst Cassirer (q.v.) in 1921, focused on Lessing and Leibniz. The following year she began working as a librarian at the Warburg Library (Kulturwissenschaflichen Bibliothek Warburg or ""KBW""), founded by Aby Warburg (q.v.), who was then hospitalized for a mental condition. She would be associated with various aspects of the Warburg the rest of her life. In 1924 Bing became Warburg's personal research assistant. Together with Fritz Saxl (q.v.) the three became the Warburg Institute of those early years. The KBW officially opened in 1926. She effectively became the director in 1927. At Warburg's death in 1929, Bing edited his <u>Gesammelten Schriften</u>. With the Nazi rise to power in 1933, the KBW, founded by and named for a Jew, fell from official favor. Together with Saxl, who was now Bing's life partner, the two moved the KBW to London as the Warburg Institute. The Institute was headed by Saxl with assistance and lecturing by Henri Frankfort (q.v.), with Bing as assistant Director. Saxl and Bing worked tirelessly to sponsor and find jobs for art historians fleeing Nazi Germany. At the beginning of World War II, Bing drove an ambulance in Britain as part of t he London Auxilliary Ambulance Service until she was dismissed as an ""enemy alien."" Saxl and Bing's home in Dulwich was open to many scholars throughout their career, including the young art historian couple from New York University, Harry Bober (q.v.) and Phyllis Pray Bober (q.v.). In 1948 Saxl died and was succeed as director by Frankfort. Bing succeeded Frankfort at his death in 1954, lecturing at the University of London as the Professor of the History of the Classical Tradition.

Born's parents were Gustav Born (1850-1900), a professor of anatomy and embryology at the University in Breslau, and Berthe Lipstein (Born). Born served in World War I in the sanitary corps. After the war he married Susi Bial in 1918 studying studio art at schools between 1919-1923 in Munich and under Ěädouard Vuillard in Paris. As an artist, Born issued a series of lithographs in 1921 to illustrate the 1912 novella <u>Der Tod in Venedig</u> (Death in Venice) by Thomas Mann (1875-1955). Mann so approved of the art that he wrote Born, revealing for the first time that the protagonist was drawn from the composer Gustav Mahler (1860-1911). Born moved to Vienna the same year, divorcing Bial in 1925. In Vienna he worked as a free-lance journalist, book illustrator, radio art critic and extension professor at the Volkshochschule. He turned to art history in 1928, attending classes at the universities of Munich, under <a href=""/wolfflinh"">Heinrich WĚ¦lfflin</a> and Vienna under <a href=""/strzygowski"">Josef Stryzgowski</a>. Born wrote his dissertation under Strzygowski in 1931 on the topic of animal representation in interlace design of illustrated books. He worked briefly as an expertizer at the Dorotheum in Vienna, but the rise of the Nazis in Germany in 1933 prevented further publishing there (though Roman Catholic, he was of Jewish extraction). Shortly before the annexation of Austria by the Third Reich, Born emigrated to the United States in 1937 to avoid persecution. In the United States he secured a job as Art Director at Maryville College, St. Louis, MO, teaching art and art history. He became a U.S. citizen in 1943. The following year he moved to New York, taking a position at Queens College, New York, then professor of Art History at Louisiana State University, New Orleans, 1945-1948. Born wrote the obituary for WĚ¦lfflin in the <u>College Art Journal</u> in 1945. In Louisiana Born married a second time to Mary Mercer in 1946. He returned to New York in 1948 as professor of art history at Hunter College (City University of New York). The same year Born published <u>American Landscape Painting; an Interpretation</u>, which brought to the attention of the American reading public the importance of American art (Wickiser). He suffered a heart attack and died in 1949. Born's half brother (through his father's first marriage) was the Nobel-prize-winning physicist Max Born (1882-1970). Born's publications were largely journal articles, ranging from the scholarly to the non-art publications. From Strzygowski, he drew an appreciation of psychological aspects of art, publishing articles in art in several psychology journals.

261,"Brieger, Peter H.",1898,"Breslau, Silesia, Prussia; [present day Wroclaw, Poland]",1983,"Toronto, Canada","University of Toronto professor and early Courtauld Institute scholar. Brieger was born to Oskar Brieger, (d. 1914), an otolaryngologist and Hedwig Lion. He grew up in this affluent family under the tutelage of a governess, surrounded by books, and a summer home where his father had built a home theater for family drama productions. Their furniture was designed by Hans Poelzig (now in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge University). As a child, he attended the St. Maria Magdalena Gymnasium. After receiving his <i> abiture</i> in 1916, he fought for Germany in World War I where he was wounded in Flanders. After the armistice in 1919, Brieger studied various humanistic disciplines at the universities in Breslau and Munich. He finally settled up on art history, studying under Wilhelm Pinder (q.v.) and, more significantly for him, Paul Frankl (q.v.) and Heinrich WĚ¦lfflin (q.v.). Between 1922-1927 he was an assistant under August Grisebach (q.v.) at Breslau. He received his Ph.D. in art history in 1924, writing a dissertation under Grisebach on Baroque art. It was partially published in 1926. Between 1927-1928 he researched at the Bibliotheca Hertziana in Rome. He became a <i>privatdozent</i> at Breslau under Grisebach, writing his habilitation on 19th-century history painting in Germany in 1927 (published in Berlin in 1930). Brieger continued as a<i> privatdozent</i> under Dagobert Frey (q.v.) between 1930 and1933. In 1931 he married Barbara Ritter, an historian. In 1933, anticipating the Jewish persecution in Nazi-Germany, Brieger left for Paris. He was officially classified a ""non-Aryan"" by the Nazi government (his family came from Jewish lineage) in 1934, when he finally fled to London. There, he secured work on the <u>Atlas of Medieval Art and Architecture in England</u>, being produced at the Courtauld Institute. The Institute conducted classes largely with temporary appointment faculty, of whom Brieger was one. His years in London turned his attention toward English medieval art, and he remained a medievalist for the rest of his career. In 1936 he moved to Canada seeking permanent employment. There he taught art history at the University of Toronto, rising through the ranks: lecturer and then associate professor, finally professor in 1947. In 1957 he wrote the volume <u>English Art, 1216-1307</u> for the <u>Oxford History of English Art</u>, edited by Thomas Boase (q.v.). He chaired the department between 1965 and 1969. Brieger was a visiting member at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, NJ for the 1964-1965 year. After retirement in 1969 he edited a facsimile edition with Millard Meiss (q.v.) and Charles S. Singleton (1909-1985) on Dante manuscripts. He was a part-time professor at the Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies in Toronto until 1973. He contributed to the National Gallery of Canada exhibition, ""Art and the Courts: France and England from 1259 to 1328"" in 1972.Brieger is considered ""a pioneer in Art History as an academic discipline in Canada"" (Eleen).",Germany;UK;Canada,"Wendland, Ulrike. <u>Biographisches Handbuch deutschsprachiger Kunsthistoriker im Exil: Leben und Werk der unter dem Nationalsozialismus verfolgten und vertriebenen Wissenschaftler</u>.

He married Ida Laura Anna Marie von Froschauer in 1868. Plans for the museum were formulated from 1873 to 1875 thorugh a design of Carl Johann Christian Zimmermann. The Museum was opened in 1877, located on Steintorplatz, officially known as the Staatliches Technikum und Museum fĚ_r Kunst und Gewerbe (State Center for Technology and Msueum of Fine and Useful Arts). Brinckmann collected a wide range of objects for the museum, from Renaissance painting to Viennese furniture to Japanese prints. He lectured publicly on the collection. Beginning in 1878, one person in Brinckmann's audience was the young <a href=""/lichtwarka"">Alfred Lichtwark</a>. The two became friends with Brinckmann introducing Lichtwark to the Hamburg industrials Carl Kall, who funded Lichtwark's later studies in art history. The young Otto KĚ_mmel, later director of the Berlin Museums, volunteered under Brinckmann in 1902-1904. After Brinckmann's death,<a href=""/sauerlandtm""> Max Sauerlandt</a> succeeded him as director in 1919. The Justus Brinckmann Gesellschaft, Hamburg, is named in his honor.

303,"Buchthal, Hugo ",1909,"Berlin, Germany",1996,"London, England, UK","Professor of Fine Arts, Institute of Fine Arts, NYU. Buchthal was born to Eugen Buchthal (1878-1954) and Thea Wolff (Buchthal) (1886-1968), wealthy shop owners. The family lived in the ""Villa Buchthal"" on Berlin's west end (after the war, the home of tenor Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, b. 1925). Buchthal attended the Herder-Reform-Gymnasium in Charlottenberg, graduating in 1927. After a semester studying economics, he switched to art history, attending classes at the universities including the Sorbonne, Paris, Heidelberg and Berlin before settling on the so-called new ""Hamburg school"" art historians Fritz Saxl (q.v.), Edgar Wind (q.v.) and Erwin Panofsky (q.v.) and the concomitant Warburg Institute, then directed by Saxl. The accession of power in Germany by the Nazis in 1933 meant that all Jewish university faculty were being summarily discharged. Saxl warned Buchthal that if he could not finish his dissertation by the end of 1933, he would be forced to leave the Warburg without a degree, as the Institute was closing its doors. Panofsky was already living in New York as a visiting professor, but returned briefly to Hamburg that summer for his students oral examinations and dissertations. Buchthal finished his dissertation in the two summer weeks for Panofsky to grant the degree, writing on the Codex Pariinus Graecus 139. He emigrated in 1934 for ""racial reasons"" (he was Jewish) to London with the Warburg Institute staff and library. The Warburg in London became a center for German refugee scholars like Buchthal, including, among others Ernst Gombrich (q.v.) and Wind. In 1935 he studied Arabic at the School of Oriental and African Studies before receiving a fellowship from 1936 to 1937 at the University of Beirut. He was the 1938 Lord Plumer Fellow at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. That same year he also re-edited and published his dissertation, <u>The Illustrations of the Paris Psalter: a Study in Middle Byzantine Painting</u> (1938). In 1939 her married Amalia ""Maltschi"" Serkin (1904-1996), sister of the pianist Rudolf Serkin (1903-1991). The Warburg Institute was evacuated to Denham, England, at the outbreak of World War II. Buchthal acted as librarian for the Institute during 1941-43, becoming a Lecturer a the University of London 1944-45 (which subsumed the Institute). He was a visiting fellow at Dumbarton Oaks 1950-51 and again in 1965. In 1957 he published perhaps his most influential book, <u> Miniature Painting in the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem</u>. Buchthal was the first to organize the illuminated manuscripts produced in the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, from the twelfth-century Melisende Psalter to the later manuscripts written in Acre, into a cohesive body for discussion. His book remains a detailed introduction to the manuscripts and a comprehensive study of Crusader miniature painting. In 1959-60 Buchtal was appointed a temporary member at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, NJ. The years 1960-65 Buchthal was an endowed chair at the Warburg Institute with the year 1963 as a visiting professor at Columbia University, New York. Between 1965-75 he was the first Ailsa Mellon Bruce Chair in Fine Arts at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University. He was a Guggenheim Fellow in 1970 and 1971. The1970s were a period of great publishing activity for Buchthal. His books include works on both French and Italian manuscripts of the legend of the fall of Troy, <u>Historia Troiana</u> (1971), and later Byzantine painting, <u>Patronage in Thirteenth-century Constantinople</u>, with Hans Belting (q.v.), (1978). From 1975 onward he was a professor emeritus at New York University. Buchthal's students at the Warburg included Michael Kauffmann (q.v.), who would later become its director. His Institute of Fine Arts students included Harvey Stahl (q.v.). Buchthal died of a heart ailment at age 87; his wife, Amalia, died less than a week later. Buchthal's area was Byzantine and western medieval art. His 1957 <u> Miniature Painting in the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem</u> (1957) was praised for weaving paleographic and liturgical analysis with meticulous visual skill. Buchthal was particularly interested in the transfers of traditions and culture between the medieval east and west. He is credited for opening the area of Crusader culture as an area for art historical study. Thomas F. Mathews (q.v.), a former student, described Buchthal's writings as laying ""the foundation for all subsequent work on the art of the Crusaders."" ",Germany;UK;USA,"Buchthal, Hugo.

307,"Burchard, Ludwig",1886,"Mainz, Germany",1960,"London, England, UK","Peter Paul Rubens scholar. Burchard's father was an apothecary in Mainz, Georg Burchard. Burchard himself attended the Grossherzogliches Gymnasium in Karlsruhe, graduating in 1904. He studied at the universities of Munich, Heidelberg and Halle-Wittenberg. During this time he volunteered at the print room in Dresden and Berlin where he earned the praise of director <a href=""/bodew"">Wilhem von Bode</a>. Burchard served in the German army in World War I in field artillery. His 1917 dissertation was written at Halle under <a href=""/goldschmidta"">Adolph Goldschmidt</a> on Rembrandt etchings. He married Lily Stange in 1919. In the 1920s he was editor of the <u> Allgemeines K</u><u>Ě_nstler-Lexikon</u> founded by <a href=""/thiemeu"">Ulrich Thieme</a> and <a href=""/beckerf"">Felix Becker</a>, (""Thieme-Becker"") in Leipzig. He was also on the staff of the periodical <u>Kunstchronik</u>. Burchard moved to Berlin as the editor of <u>Zeitschrift f</u><u>Ě_r bildenden Kunst</u>, 1921-22. In 1921, too, he completed the volume on Rubens in the <u>Klassiker der Kunst</u> series left undone by the premature death of <a href=""/oldenbourgr"">Rudolf Oldenbourg</a>. It was at this time that he envisioned a new <i>catalogue raisonn</i><i>Ě©</i> of Rubens' work, the task of which would be his life's assignment. A brief article on Cornelis van Dalem in the <u>Jahrbuch des Preussischen Kunstsammlung</u> in 1924 establish the importance of that little-known master. One of his assistants during this time was the young art historian and later important modernist <a href=""/wescherh"">Hertha Wescher</a>. The ascension to power of the Nazi's in 1933 meant trouble for Burchard, who, though nominally protestant, had a Jewish mother. He emigrated to London in 1935, settling outside the city with his then large archive of Rubens material. Burchard took in other emingres to work on his project, including <a href=""/grossmannf"">Fritz Grossmann</a>. In 1939 Burchard published a prospectus of his upcoming catalog, <u>The Work of Peter Paul Rubens</u>, then projected for six volumes. The outbreak of World War II halted his publishing plans, however. In England, Burchard was intern briefly in 1940. After the war, many Rubens paintings appeared on the market and others, still, required cleaning and re-examination after their hiding in bomb shelters. Thus the critical catalog project was once again delayed. In 1955 Burchard conducted seminar on Rubens for the annual summer ""Belgian Art Seminar"" which had been established in 1951 by Herman Liebaers, Director of the Royal Library of Belgium. The following year Burchard expanded this to a Rubenshius exhibition of Rubens drawings, celebrating Burchard's 75th birthday. The exhibition catalog, co-written with <a href=""/hulstr"">Roger d'Hulst</a><a href=""/dhulstr""></a>, was expanded in 1963 and remains one of the most important monographs on the topic. Burchard frequented the major auction houses and provided many written opinions to them. At Burchard's death, his papers were acquired by the Kunsthistorische Musea by <a href=""/baudouinf"">Frans Baudouin</a> principally to edit the core of the Rubenianum, a documentation center for the study of Rubens and 16th- and 17th-century Flemish art. It is housed in the Kolveniersstraat in Antwerp. One stipulation of the donation was that a <i>catalogue raison</i><i>Ě©</i> on Rubens should be published based on Burchard's materials. The city of Antwerp made an agreement with Burchard's heirs and the Nationaal Centrum voor de Plastische Kunsten van de 16de en de 17de Eeuw (today the Centrum voor de Vlaamse kunst van de 16de en 17de eeuw), chaired by d'Hulst, to edit and produce the set, known as the <u>Corpus Rubenianum Ludwig Burchard</u>. Burchard was criticized during his lifetime and after for having withheld much of the material he collected or controlled at the Rubenshuis from other scholars. His own reasons for never publishing his work on Rubens were his dissatisfaction with the ever-imperfect state of Rubens information.",Germany;UK,"Baudouin, Frans, and d'Hulst, Roger.

After receiving the highest honors of her Abiturum from the Gymnasium under which she studied, she won a scholarship which enabled her to spend a year at Wells College, Aurora, NY. She returned to Germany only to find Nazi control of her selected university, Munich, too much to for a Jew such as herself to tolerate. She moved to Perugia in 1935 only to find the same political hatred there. She stayed with friends at the University in Cardiff, Wales, before securing a scholarship via the Institute for International Education to attend Bryn Mawr in 1938. She received US citizenship the same year. Without an undergraduate degree, Achenbach was permitted to begin graduate work, achieving an M.A. in 1940. In 1945 Charles Rufus Morey (q.v.) offered Achenbach a position with the Index of Christian Art at Princeton. She worked there while writing her dissertation at the Institute of Fine Art at New York University under Richard Offner (q.v.). An photograph often used in art historiographic texts of the post-war faculty of the Institute is a picture of her Ph.D. defense. Achenbach married a Princeton physicist, Thomas Coor in 1946. She received her Ph.D. in 1948 on a topic of Coppo di Marcovaldo. The years 1948-50 were spent with her husband in London where she was informally attached to the Warburg Institute. Returning to Princeton, the Coors settled permanently with Gertrude again working at the Index of Christian Art and teaching courses at Rutgers University in 1958 and 1959. She accepted a research assistant position under Millard Meiss (q.v.) at the Institute of Advanced Study in Princeton in 1959. In 1961 her book on Neroccio de' Landi appeared. As a woman in the 1950s married to a university professor, she was expected to keep house and run the other domestic activities in addition to whatever scholarship she wanted to pursue. Coor purportedly worked sixteen hours every day on her research in addition to her wife duties. Coor was a consultant for the Kress Collection at the Cleveland Museum of Art.

502,"Demus, Otto ",1902,"Harland, Austria; [near St. PĚ¦lten]",1990,"Vienna, Austria ","University of Vienna Byzantinist and San Marco scholar. Demus's father, Carl Demus, was a physician. His father was killed early during the First World War and the younger Demus partially supported of his family as an adolescent. He entered the University of Vienna in 1921 during the time of the historic (and bitter) split between the faculty of <a href=""/strzygowski"">Josef Strzygowski</a>, and <a href=""/schlosserj"">Julius von Schlosser</a>. The rivalry between these two men was such that studying with both was impossible. Demus chose Strzygowski but steered clear of the wild ""pan-Germanic"" theories of his mentor. His Ph.D., was granted under Strzygowsky, <i>cum laude</i>, in 1928. Demus spent the next years personally photographing (in color, using glass plates) Greek Byzantine monuments. In 1931 this collaborative effort with <a href=""/dieze"">Ernst Diez</a> appeared as <u>Byzantine Mosaics in Greece</u>, one of the first to employ stylistic analysis to the topic. The work was a prelude to the monument which would occupy Demus most of his life, San Marco in Venice. Demus joined the Austrian monument service as a <i>Konservator</i> (curator) in 1930. Though poorly paid and the division poorly organized, Demus worked hard on the inventory and conservation of the medieval monuments in his charge, which included Maria Saal. In 1935 he issued a small volume on San Marco, which solidified his reputation as a scholar. After six years at the monuments service, Demus moved back to the main office in Vienna and, with <i>Habilitation </i>in hand, joined his alma mater where <a href=""/sedlmayrh"">Hans Sedlmayr</a> had succeeded Schlosser. He continued to hold both positions, teaching art history and advising on conservation. With the annexation of Austria by the Nazis in 1938, Demus left, ostensibly for a Byzantine congress in Sicily in 1939, traveling to England for asylum. Demus found employment at the Warburg Library, together with other Austrian and German expatriates. He also lectured at the Courtauld Institute. In 1946 he became president of the office of monuments (Bundesdenkmalamt) in Austria. The following year he issued the slender <u> Byzantine Mosaic Decoration</u>, a synthesis of Byzantine aesthetics and iconography still considered seminal today. The war now concluded and Austria in desperate need of art historians without a recent history of Nazi compliance, Demus was tapped for the newly reorganized <i>Bundesdenkmalamt</i> (Federal Office of Monuments). Though still poorly paid, Demus was given a small house in the Belvedere gardens in which he remained for the rest of his life. He shuttled between Dumbarton Oaks, the newly established Byzantine research center under Harvard University, and Vienna. In 1960, his second title on San Marco appeared, a handbook on every aspect except the mosaics. When <a href=""/swobodak"">Karl Maria Swoboda</a> retired from the University, Demus was offered his chair. However, Demus insisted on the earlier bifurcated arrangement, nominating a Schlosser student, <a href=""/pachto"">Otto PĚ_cht</a>, to be the ""other"" chair along with his. The enmity between the two camps during their school days had been so strong that Demus had known of PĚ_cht only through subsequent scholarly publications. In 1963 they began their appointments. Demus relinquished the presidency of the Bundesdenkmalamt in 1964, succeed by <a href=""/frodlw"">Walter Frodl</a>. He issued <u>Romanesque Wall Painting</u> in 1968, which, although a coffee-table-style Hirmer Verlag production, was the result of personal and renewed familiarity with the monuments. The same year he also contributed to the summary volume of the Kariye Djami studies of <a href=""/underwoodp"">Paul Underwood</a>. He delivered the Wrightsman lectures at New York University (<u>Byzantine Art and the West</u>, 1970), a synthetic view of the influence of both cultures on each other. At age 68, Demus secured Dumbarton Oaks funding to clean the mosaics at San Marco, the necessary step in order for him to write the major work on them. In 1984, the results were published as the two-volume <u>Mosaics of San Marco in Venice</u>. In his eighties, Demus published a final book on the Carinthian (Austria) late gothic carved altarpieces. Demus' students included <a href=""/hutteri"">Irmgard Hutter</a>, who collaborated with him on the <u>Corpus der byzantinischen Miniaturenhandschriften</u>. <a href=""/beltingh"">Hans Belting</a> characterized Demus as one who ""obeyed a rigid discipline of scholarship ever since, as a young man, he had to regret the flamboyant lack of responsibility of his teacher, Strzygowski."" <u>Mosaics  of San Marco in Venice</u> led to several new findings, the most important of which was that eastern dome was the product of two different ventures, one at 1100 and a second nearly a century later when portions of the first had collapsed.",Austria,"Kleinbauer, W.

547,"Dorner, Alexander",1893,"KĚ¦nigsberg, Germany; [present day Kaliningrad, Russia]",1957,"Naples, Italy","Early progressive museum director and professor of art history and Brown University and Bennington College. Dorner came from a long line of distinguished theologians and clergy. His grandfather, Isaak August Dorner (1809-1884), had been a professor at the University of Berlin and rector. His father, August Dorner (1846-1920), was a professor of theology and Philology at Wittenberg; his mother, Alice Hasselmeyer (1862-?), was raised in English-speaking India. Like his parents, Dorner was a free-thinker and adamantly opposed the Prussian imperialism. His father did not allow his mother to teach him English, preferring to read his son Homer and Dante (Wendland). After graduating from the KĚ¦nigsberg gymnasium, Dorner entered the university at KĚ¦nigsberg, but when World War I was declared, the young man alternated military service his studies. In 1915 he transferred to the University of Berlin, studying art history, archaeology, history and philosophy. In Berlin, Dorner comprised part of a distinguished group of graduate students in art history who also included <a href=""/ledermanni"">Ida Ledermann</a>, <a href=""/huthh"">Hans Huth</a>, <a href=""/panofskye"">Erwin Panofsky</a>, and <a href=""/schenkzuschweinsberge"">Eberhard Schenk zu Schweinsberg</a>. His dissertation on Romanesque architecture, written under <a href=""/goldschmidta"">Adolph Goldschmidt</a>, was accepted for his Ph.D. in 1919. Dorner's habilitation was written the following year and he worked as a <i>Privatdozent</i>. He married Ella Grotewold around this time. Dorner joined the State Museum (Landesmuseum) in Hannover as a curator in 1923, rising to director in 1925 (one of the youngest in Germany). As such, he was responsible for many smaller museums in the Hanover area. His appointment coincided with Walter Gropius' foundation of the Bauhaus a short distance away in Weimar. Dorner was one of the early and great leaders of avant-garde art collecting in Germany in the 1920s and 1930s concentrating in Constructivist art for the collection focusing on Piet Mondrian, Naum Gabo, Kazimir Malevich, and El Lissitzky. Dorner commissioned from Moholy-Nagy was the ""Raum der Gegenwart"" (Room of the Present) which was designed to include film projections, although the space was never realized. Dorner taught as an assistant professor at the Technische Hochschule in Hannover, beginning in 1928 (through 1936), contributing to the journal <u>Museum der Gegenwart</u> (The Museum of Today) from 1930 to 1933. As a director, Dorner juxtaposed art with other objects of different periods in his installations, a new method for art museums. His progressivist art policies put him in direct opposition with the Nazi party, who assumed power in Germany in 1933. Dorner led the fight against the Nazi ""Entartete Kunst"" (degenerate art) exhibition of modern art in 1936. After the government confiscated the Museum's modern art and accused him of financial impropriety, Dorner resigned from the Museum in 1937. After briefly living in Berlin, he emigrated first to France and then the United States. With the recommendations of Panofsky (now in New York) and Museum of Modern Art director <a href=""/barra"">Alfred H. Barr, Jr.</a>, he secured the position of director of the Art Museum at the Rhode Island School of Design in 1938. At Rhode Island, Dorner reorganized the traditionally displayed works in the Museum into dramatic installations which appealed to the public. At the outbreak of World War II, Dorner's anti-Nazi history was ignored and because he was German (and had a brother flying in the Luftwaffe), he was forced to resign from the RISD museum in 1941. He lectured in art history at Brown University beginning in 1941, becoming a naturalized citizen in 1943. After the War, Dorner moved to Bennington, VT, in 1948 to be Professor for Art and Esthetics at Bennington College. He married a second time in the United States to Lydia Nepto. While on a trip to Italy to address Nazi crimes against him, he died of a heart attack in Naples at age 64. His papers are held at the Busch-Reisinger Museum, Harvard University. Tall with a dueling scar, Dorner fit the contemporary image of an expatriate German. His philosophy, however, was a<em>New York Times</em>hing but elitist. Strongly populist, he worked for installations to appeal to a greater variety of people, driving attendance levels up. His Hanover innovations in exhibition space included grouping objects in rooms by themes rather than by period. At RISD, he removed many of the traditional exhibition cases around objects to make their esthetic appeal greater. The false accusation by the FBI of his Nazi sympathy and removal from the RISD museum hurt Dorner deeply and despite exoneration in the press, Dorner never again worked for a museum.",Germany;USA,"""Dorner Shown Anti-Nazi, Failure to Rename Him Splits Rhode Island Museum Board."" <u>New York Times</u> October 17, 1941, p. 20; Kleinbauer, W.

601,"Einstein, Carl ",26 April 1885,"Neuwied, Germany",03 or 05 July 1940,"Lestelle-BĚ©tharram, France","Early writer on modern art in Germany; first to discus African art in aestheric terms and one of the first to connect it to Cubism. Einstein's father was Daniel Einstein (1847-1899), a rabbi, Hebrew teacher and cantor. His mother was Sophie Lichtenstein (Einstein) (b. 1860). In 1888 the family moved to Karlsruhe, where the younger Einstein initially studied Banking. Between 1904-1908 he attended the philosophy lectures of Georg Simmel (1858-1918) at the University of Berlin and art historical lectures of <a href=""/wolfflinh"">Heinrich WĚ¦lfflin</a>. Because Einstein lacked a high school diploma (<em>Abitur</em>) he was unable to attain his doctorate. In 1907 he made his first trip to Paris where he discovered Picasso, Braque, Gris and other artists. He wrote prose, joining the radical circle of Franz Pfemfert (1879-1954) and his magazine <u>Die Aktion</u>. In 1912 Einstein's novel, <u>Bebuquin oder die Dilettanten des Wunders</u>, appeared, which included the graphic illustrations of the German Expressionist artist Wilhelm Lehmburck. He married Maria Ramm, Pfemfert's daughter, in 1913 (divorced 1923). His first well-known work was an art-historical piece on primitivism, called <u> Negerplastik</u> (<u>Black Sculpture</u>). <u>Negerplastik</u> circulated widely among avant-garde artists of the time, though it incited controversy within the intellectual community, including the philosopher Ernst Bloch (1885-1977), the authors Hermann Hesse (1877-1862) and Hanns Johst (1890-1978) and the art historians <a href=""/fechheimerh"">Hedwig Fechheimer</a>, <a href=""/glaserc"">Curt Glaser</a>, <a href=""/hausensteinw"">Wilhelm Hausenstein</a> and <a href=""/tietzeh"">Hans Tietzte</a>. In World War I, he was a soldier stationed in Brussels. Immediately after the war he lived in Berlin (1919-1928), working on the weekly magazine of Wieland Herzfelde (1896-1988) and George Grosz, <u>Die Pleite</u>. He became editor and publisher of the satirical paper <u>Der blutige Ernst</u>. He wrote several short essays on artists for <u>Das Kunstblatt</u> under <a href=""/westheimp"">Paul Westheim</a> as well as for <u>Der Querschnitt</u>, <u>Action</u> (Paris) and <u>Die neue Rundschau</u>. His satirical depiction of god in <u>Die schlimme Botschaft</u> resulted in a fine. In 1922 he was commissioned to write the volume on <u>Die Kunst des 20. Jahrhunderts</u> for the PropylĚ_en Art History series. It's publication in 1926 made it the first survery of modern art (Foster et al). Einstein's contacts with artists and dealers such as Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler (1884-1979) and others resulted in a diverse selection of art objects. In 1928, branded as a communist, he moved to Paris and, with Georges Bataille (1897-1962) and others, published the magazine <u>Documents</u>, 1929-1931. Einstein sided with Bataille in view of Surrealism that radically contrasted the official line set forth by AndrĚ© Breton (1896-1966). He wrote a monograph on Braque (1934) though more a theoretical work on the Cubist movement than the artist himself. In the 1930s, Einstein produced his <u>Handbuch der Kunst</u> which focuses primarily on modern art. He married a second time, in 1932, to an Armenian woman, Lydia Guevrekian. By this time he had become disillusioned by most modern artists has having capitulated to the ruling authorities. Though disillusioned with communism as well, he volunteered as a soldier in the Spanish civil war 1936-1937. After the defeat by Franco, Einstein returned to Paris, writing a German expatriate newsletter. With the fall of France in 1940 he was arrested by Vichy government officials and deported to the concentration camp at Lager Gurs. Though released he found himself unable to emigrate again to Spain. Hunted by the Gestapo for his communist beliefs and Jewish heritage, he committed suicide by throwing himself into the Pau river. The Kahnweiler placed a plaque in his gallery ""Freedom fighter"".  <u>Negerplastik</u> is one of the early links of so-called primitive sculpture and the modern art movement. The book was the first to discuss African sculpture in esthetic terms as opposed to ethnographic artifacts (Foster, et al). It postulated a spatial way of seeing ""plastisches Sehen"" that addresses the problems of Cubism. It is not a history of African sculpture as it ignored the peoples who made the sculptures. Einstein adhered strongly to the notion that sculpture ""spoke"" directly to the viewer and therefore required no background information. <u>Die Kunst des 20.  Jahrhunderts</u> represented a genuinely original vision of modern art. Together with an handful of other modernist art historians, such as <a href=""/osbornm"">Max Osborn</a> and <a href=""/schmidtp"">Paul Ferdinand Schmidt</a> he ushered in modern art as an art-historical subject in Germany. His criticism is akin to that of the Frankfurt School theorists, particularly Theodor Adorno (1903-1969) and Walter Benjamin (1892-1940) (Foster et al). Einstein had his blind spots, however.  His Marxist beliefs precluded an appreciation of German Expressionism until after World War I, preferring French Cubism largely because of its closer connection to African art. His analytical style, especially in the shorter reviews of artists, often has a hyper-critical edge to it. Because of the political and cultural events of the 1930s, his major literary theory, <u>  Fabrikation der Fiktionen</u>, only appeared in 1973.",Germany;France,"[book review] Fechheimer, Hedwig.

Eisner's father was Hugo Eisner (1856-1924), a textile exporter and magistrate, and her mother Margarethe Feodora Aron (1866-1942). She was raised in a prosperous middle-class Jewish family living in near the Zoo quarter of Berlin. After receiving her <i>Abitur</i> at the Humanistisches Gymnasium in Karlsruhe, 1917, she studied archaeology, art history and philosophy at the universities in Berlin (under Heinrich WĚ¦lfflin, q.v.), Freiburg im Breisgau (under Ludwig Curtius, q.v.), Munich and finally Rostock where she was awarded her Ph.D. Her dissertation, written under the classicist Gottfried von LĚ_cken (q.v.) on the compositional development of Greek vases, was accepted in 1924. She worked on Italian archaeological excavations in Italy, 1924-1926 and then journalism for the newspapers <u>Literarische Welt</u> and the <u>Berliner Tageblatt</u>, 1926-1927, writing arts reviews. She met Hans Feld (1909-1992) editor of the Berlin film periodical <u>Filmkuriers</u> in 1927. Feld invited her to review, and Eisner became the first woman film critic. Jewish and an exponent of Expressionism, the hated movement by the Nazis, she became a target of persecution. <u>Filmkuriers</u> was purged of Jews by the Nazis and, after a phone call warned her of her impending arrest, she fled to France in 1933 to live with her sister in Paris. Between 1933 and 1939 she was a film correspondent for the British <u>Film World News</u>, the Czech <u> Internationale Filmschau</u> and <u>Die Kritik</u>, supporting herself as a secretary, nanny and translator. When France entered World War II, Eisner was interned in an enemy alien camp at Gurs, France, for three months. She escaped and, using the name Louise Escoffier, worked as a cook in Figeac (dĚ©paretment Lot) of unoccupied France. Her mother perished in the camp at Theresienstadt, Czechoslovakia, in 1942. Even before the end of the war, Eisner worked for the film preservationist Henri Langlois (1914-1977), inventorying films he had saved from Nazi destruction. In 1945 she was appointed chief conservator for the CinĚ©mathĚ¬que franĚ¤aise in Palais de Challiot, Paris. She was naturalized a French citizen in 1952.

Ettlinger was born to Emil Ettlinger and Dora Beer (Ettlinger), his father the university librarian in KĚ¦nigsberg. After receiving his <i>Abitur</i> from the Gynmasium in Halle in 1932, he studied at the universities of Halle and Marburg. His fields of concentration included archaeology, philosophy and art history (under Paul Frankl, q.v.). He received his Ph.D. in Halle under Herbert Koch (q.v.) in 1937, writing on the topic of Gottfried Semper and the ancient world. Between 1935-37 he assisted Koch cataloging the the collection of Crete and Mycenean objects, photodocumenting them for the archaeological museum in Halle. Because of his Jewish background Ettlinger was forced to leave Germany for England in 1938, working at the Warburg Institute and living with Fritz Saxl (q.v.). He married Amrei Jacoby in 1939 (d. 1955). Nikolaus Pevsner (q.v.) secured him a job working as a social worker in children's refugee camps (Movement for the Care of Children from Germany), 1940-1941. He was interned briefly in 1940 on the Isle of Man, together with other Warburg refugees. After his release he was made a member of the Warburg Institute. Ettlinger published his first English-language essays in the <u>Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes</u>. He supported himself during the years 1941-1948 as an assistant master of Edward VI's school in Birmingham for six years and writing a volume for Allen Lane's King Penguin book series in 1947 on Christmas cards. In 1948, Saxl appointed Ettlinger curator of the photographic collection of the Warburg, now part of the University of London, shortly before Saxl's sudden death. Ettlinger also lectured at the University of Reading. After 1956 he was a lecturer at the Warburg (to 1964). At the suggestion of Erwin Panofsky (q.v.), Ettlinger spent part of the1956 year at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, studying the Sixtus' early painting patronage. The result would be his well-received 1965 book, <u>The Sistine Chapel before Michelangelo: Religious Imagery and Papal Primacy</u>. In 1959 he married Madeleine Jay Noirot and replaced E. H. Gombrich (q.v.) as the Durning Lawrence Professor of the History of Art at the Slade School, University College. His 1961 inaugural lecture was on the current status of art history (""Art History Today""). He lectured for the academic year 1963-1964 at Yale University. While chair of the department (1966-70) he helped created joint degree programs in the art history department. In 1970 Ettlinger accepted the chairmanship of the Department of the History of Art at the University of California at Berkeley. There he had many students and earned a reputation as an outstanding lecturer: persuasive arguments, perfect delivery and moving elocution. Ettlinger married a third time to Helen Shahrokh Lewis (later divorced), with whom he wrote a monograph on Botticelli in 1976. At Berkeley he issued his <i>catalogue raisonnĚ©</i> of the Pollaiuolo, <u>Antonio and Piero Pollaiuolo: Complete Edition with a Critical Catalogue</u>. He remained on the Berkeley faculty until 1980. On Easter, 1979 he was received into the Roman Catholic faith, surprising to some, but to others the culmination of his engagement with Christianity through his work on the Sistine Chapel.

Frankl's family stemmed from a line of Jewish scholars. His father a Prague businessman, was Carl Frankl and his mother Amalia von Wiener (Frankl). He attended to German Staats-Obergymnasium in Prague, graduating in 1896. Following a year's service in the Austrian military at a Lieutenant's rank in 1897, he entered the Technische Hochschule in Munich and then Berlin, graduating with a degree in (practicing) architecture in 1904. He married an artist, Elsa Johanna Herzberg in 1905, working as an architect. He returned school in 1908, studying philology, history and art history at Ludwig-Maximilians-UniversitĚ_t in Munich, the latter topic under <a href=""/wolfflinh"">Heinrich WĚ¦lfflin</a>. Frankl's dissertation advisor, however, was <a href=""/riehlb"">Berthold Riehl</a>, founder of the Institut fĚ_r Kunstgeschichte (Art History Institute) there. The topic was on fifteenth-century glass painting in southern Germany, accepted in 1910. Frankl remained at Munich as WĚ¦lfflin's assistant (through 1913), who was now Reihl's successor, writing his <em>Habilitationschrift</em> on developmental phases in architecture under WĚ¦lfflin. While this work employed WĚ¦lfflin's theoretical structure of development (and was dedicated to the master), it rejected WĚ¦lfflin's formalism. Frankl worked as a <em>privatdozent</em> at Munich from 1914, exempt from military service in World War I because of an amputated arm, participating in the <u>Handbuch der Kunstwissenschaft</u> editions (under the editorship of <a href=""/brinckmanna"">Albert Brinckmann</a> and <a href=""/burgerf"">Fritz Burger</a>) beginning in 1916. In 1920 he was promoted to <em>auĚŮerordentlicher</em> (assistant) Professor at Munich, called the following year to become <em>ordentlicher</em> (full) Professor at Halle. It was there that Frankl turned to the topic of Gothic architecture, which would become his life's work and fame. His 1924 contribution to WĚ¦lfflin's festschrift--a seminal essay--theorized stylistic laws governing Gothic and Romanesque architecture. Two years later it was expanded into his book <u>Baukunst des Mittelalters</u>. In 1933 at the 13th International Congress of the History of Art, Stockholm, he traveled with a group of medievalists including <a href=""/hamannr"">Richard Hamann</a>, <a href=""/conantk"">Kenneth Conant</a> and <a href=""/hahnloserh"">Hans Hahnloser</a>, lead by <a href=""/roosvalj"">Johnny Roosval</a>, to see the discovery of the only gothic church still with its wooden arch scaffolding remaining (Frankl, <u>Gothic</u>). That same year the Nazis assumed control of the German government forcing the dismissal of Jews from government positions, including academics. Frankl was terminated in 1934, returning to Munich were he lived in poverty. After a brief trip to Constantinople, he published his important theory of art-historical practice, <u>Das System der Kunstwissenschaft</u> issued in Czechoslovakia because works by Jewish authors were no longer permitted in Germany or Austria. The 1000-plus-page treatise is his most pure example of his <em>Kunstwissenschaft</em> notion, a systematic art history covering all principles in all forms from all periods. This book was among those the Nazi's selected for their book burnings. He traveled to the United States in 1938 but was prevented from returning because of illness. He was financially assisted in the U.S. by the German-American museum director <a href=""/valentinerw"">Wilhelm R. Valentiner</a>. In 1940 Frankl was appointed a member of the Institute of Advanced Study in Princeton through the initiative of Princeton University professor <a href=""/moreyc"">Charles Rufus Morey</a> and Institute of Advanced Study member (and fellow Nazi-refugee) <a href=""/panofskye"">Erwin Panofsky</a>. Panofsky argued for the non-teaching IAS position because Frankl's English was too poor to lecture in U.S. schools. Frankl spent much of his efforts at Princeton writing a book on the commentaries on the Gothic from that time to the present. After the War, <a href=""/pevsnern"">Nikolaus Pevsner</a> invited him to write the volume on Gothic architecture for his English-language survey series, the <u>Pelican History of Art</u>. In 1948 Frankl returned to Germany as a guest lecturer at the universities of Berlin and Halle and in the United States at Yale University. From 1951 onward he took as his assistant the wife of Princeton medievalist <a href=""/weitzmannk"">Kurt Weitzmann</a>, Josepha Weitzmann-Fiedler (1904-2000). She helped him see the completion of his manuscript for the <u>Gothic Architecture</u> volume for the <u>Pelican History of art</u>, completed in German in 1956 and his Gothic literature study, <u>The Gothic: Literary Sources and Interpretations through Eight Centuries</u>, published in 1960. He finished reading the English translation of the manuscript of the <u>Gothic Architecture</u> volume the day before he died, at his desk, at the Institute, at age 83. A revision of his <u>System der Kunstwissenschaft</u> remained unfinished, but was later issued under Weitzmann-Fiedler's direction in 1988 as <u>Zu Fragen des Stills</u>. His students in Halle included <a href=""/krautheimerr"">Richard Krautheimer</a> and <a href=""/grotel"">Ludwig Grote</a>. Frankl was one of the giants of <em>Kunstwissenschaft</em> (Crossley) as well as one of the last. This theoretical approach to art history had been practiced most profoundly by Vienna School historian <a href=""/riegla"">Alois Reigl</a> and WĚ¦lfflin. His <em>Kunstwissenschaft</em> writing consistently shows an interest in principles and categories--visual and intellectual--that control the viewer, the work of art and the conditions of its construction (Krautheimer). In <u>Das System der Kunstwissenschaft</u> Frankl demonstrated his ambition to create a comprehensive art history. Broken down into numerous categories (persons, things, places, time) and then into intricate substructures, (membrism, regularism, limitism, harmonism, etc.), the work constitutes ""probably the most ambitious morphological and phenomenological study of the visual arts ever undertaken"" (Crossley). He coined terms, such as ""akyrism"" to define the changing contexts and meanings of art, mostly clearly realized in his final article on Boucher's 1752 painting ""Girl on the Counch."" Frankl's system was not always easy to follow, a fact about which Frankl himself worried. His emphasis on space as an analytic for architecture can be traced to the earlier pioneering work of <a href=""/brinckmanna"">Albert Brinckmann</a> (Watkin). Frankl saw French Gothic architecture as a progressive style of the avante-garde, a laboratory of diverse ideas, in similar ways to the work of <a href=""/bonyj"">Jean Bony</a>.

725,"FriedlĚ_nder, Max J.",05 June 1867,"Berlin, Germany",11-Oct-58,"Amsterdam, Netherlands ","Netherlandish art scholar and director Kaiser Friedrich Museum. FriedlĚ_nder was the son of Leopold FriedlĚ_nder (1832-ca.1880), a Berlin banker, and Helene Noether (FriedlĚ_nder) (1843-after 1901). He began studying art history in 1891 in Munich, continuing in Florence (under <a href=""/schmarsowa"">August Schmarsow</a>, and ultimately Leipzig, writing a dissertation on Albrecht Altdorfer under <a href=""/springera"">Anton Springer</a>. FriedlĚ_nder volunteered at the graphics collection (Kupferstichkabinett) of the Berlin State Museums under <a href=""/lippmannf"">Friedrich Lippmann</a> in 1891 and the Wallraf-Richartz-Museum in Cologne between 1895-96 under <a href=""/scheiblerl"">Ludwig Scheibler</a>. Through Lippmann's recommendation, he joined the GemĚ_ldegalerie (Paintings Department) of the Berlin State Museums in 1896 under <a href=""/bodew"">Wilhelm Bode</a>. He was appointed Deputy Director (immediately under Bode) in 1904, adding the Kupferstichkabinett responsibilities of the Museum in 1908. He and Bode were responsible for the great acquisitions years of the Berlin museums, with FriedlĚ_nder personally donating a number of works to the GemĚ_ldegalerie and Kupferstichkabinett. In 1924, FriedlĚ_nder began publishing his magnum opus, a history of early Netherlandish painting artist by artist, which, for its detail and documentation, has never been surpassed. He succeeded Bode as Director in 1924. He and <a href=""/rosenbergj"">Jakob Rosenberg</a> wrote a monograph on Lucas Cranach in 1932. His retirement age coincided with the ascension of the Nazi rise in 1933 and the proscriptions against Jews in federal employment. He left museum, working as a private expertiser for German and foreign art dealers, enjoying the protection of Nazi <i>Reichmarshall</i> Hermann Goering (1893-1946) whose art collection he helped advise.  FriedlĚ_nder emigrated to his spiritual home of Amsterdam in 1939. After the German occupation of the Netherlands during World War II, an erroneous arrest was reversed through intervention of the Nazi art dealer Karl Haberstock (1878-1956) who was also working for Goering. FriedlĚ_nder's book, <u>On Art and Connoisseurship</u>, appeared first in English in 1942 and in German only after the war as, <u>Von Kunst und Kennerschaft</u> in 1946. Shortly before his death, his 1916 <u>Von Eyck bis Bruegel</u> was revised and edited by <a href=""/grossmannf"">Fritz Grossmann</a> and published in 1956 in English as <u>From Van Eyck to Bruegel, Early Netherlandish Painting</u>. Though methodologically a connoisseur-style art historian, FriedlĚ_nder was a severe critic of the method of <a href=""/morellig"">Giovanni Morelli</a>, as was Bode. This may have been as much an anti-Austrian, anti-academician stance, since Morelli was most highly revered by the University of Vienna art historian <a href=""/wickhofff"">Franz Wickhoff</a>. FriedlĚ_nder wrote that ""Academicians enter the museum with ideas, art connoisseurs leave it with ideas."" (Ladis).  Vienna school art historians generally were distained by the Berlin museum directors. FriedlĚ_nder retorted to <a href=""/panofskye"">Erwin Panofsky</a>, after seeing the posthumously titled book <u>Art History as  the History of the Mind</u> (<u>Kunstgeschichte als Geistesgeschichte</u>), by the Vienna school (and van Eyck) scholar, <a href=""/dvorakm"">Max Dvo�ŞĚÁk</a>, that ""we [in the museum world] are engaged in the physical art history"" (KĚ¦rpergeschichte). FriedlĚ_nder's brand of connoisseurship relied on intuition and vast experience rather than a Morellian cataloging of stylistic idiosyncrasies of an individual artist. His realm was the rarified world of the dealer and connoisseur:  he never gave a public lecture (Panofsky). His interests within art, however, were wide-ranging. A monograph on the contemporary artist Max Liebermann written by FriedlĚ_nder included works from FriedlĚ_nder's own collection. Other modernist art books by FriedlĚ_nder included ones on Max Slevogt and the French Impressionists, of whose styles he, unlike Bode, approved. Next to Bode, FriedlĚ_nder was the most consulted ""art expert"" in Berlin (Wendland). Many of the most important art historians of the next generation passed through his Print Room as volunteers. These included <a href=""/lanyij"">JenĚ¦ LĚÁnyi</a>. During the last part of his life he was often compared to the other nonagenarian connoisseur art historian, <a href=""/berensonb"">Bernard Berenson</a>, though the two had little in common. He is not related to the German-American art historian <a href=""/friedlanderw"">Walter FriedlĚ_nder</a>.",Germany;Netherlands,"Kleinbauer, W.

726,"FriedlĚ_nder, Walter F.",1873,"Glogau, Germany; [present day Poland]",1966,"New York, NY, USA","New York University baroque scholar, 1935-42. FriedlĚ_nder was the son of Sigismund FriedlĚ_nder, a merchant, and Anna Joachimsthal (FriedlĚ_nder). Orphaned early in life, FriedlĚ_nder was raised a Lutheran, though his deceased parents had both been Jewish. He moved at age 13 to live with a sister in Berlin, where he obtained the nickname ""Fridolin."" FriedlĚ_nder attended the University in Berlin studying Sanscrit under Albrecht Weber (1825-1901). He also spent a semester in Geneva studying linguistics under Ferdinand de Saussure (1857-1913). His Ph.D. on the topic of the Sanskrit language was granted in Berlin in 1898. In 1900 he traveled to London on a post-doctorate fellowship at the British Museum. The treasures of the National Gallery convinced him to become an art historian. He returned to Berlin taking courses in art history under <a href=""/wolfflinh"">Heinrich WĚ¦lfflin</a>, although Berlin would not allow a second Ph.D. FriedlĚ_nder wrote newspapers magazine reviews under the pseudonym ""Dr. Friedrich Walter,"" from 1904 onward. He traveled to Italy, and, in 1912 wrote his book on Federico Barocci which established him as an art historian. His next monograph, on Nicolas Poussin, in 1914 was the result of study in Paris. Unfortunately, a book on the same subject, published by <a href=""/grautoffo"">Otto Grautoff</a> appeared the same year, largely overshadowing his accomplishment. In 1914, too, he married Emma Cardin and became a <i>Privatdozent</i> at the University of Freiburg am Breisgau. The Freiburg art history department was led by the eminent medievalist <a href=""/vogew"">Wilhelm VĚ¦ge</a>, who had initiated the art history seminar in 1908. FriedlĚ_nder's inaugural lecture re-evaluated the Mannerist period of Italian painting in a talk entitled ""Anti-classical Style of 1520."" FriedlĚ_nder was a visionary here, especially considering that WĚ¦lfflin's <u>Grundbegriffe</u>, which would appear the following year, still considered the last sixteenth century an ignorable period. FriedlĚ_nder taught a range of courses from medieval to nineteenth-century. Among his first students was the brilliant <a href=""/panofskye"">Erwin Panofsky</a> who eventually wrote his dissertation under VĚ¦ge in 1914. VĚ¦ge suffered a mental collapse in 1916, leaving FriedlĚ_nder to carry much of the teaching load. In 1925 FriedlĚ_nder published his lecture on early (Mannerist) ""Anti-classicism,"" a second in 1929 on later and post-Mannerism, and an primer on the early modernist movement, <u>Von David bis Delacroix</u> in 1932. For this, he was promoted to <i>Nichtbeamtete Professor extraordinarius</i>, but not full professor. Panofsky, now at the University in Hamburg and the Warburg Library, oversaw publication of a festschrift to FriedlĚ_nder in 1933, despite FriedlĚ_nder's largely formalist methodological approach. Before FriedlĚ_nder could retire and the festschrift printed, the Nazis dismissed Panofsky and FriedlĚ_nder on ""racial/Jewish"" grounds. FriedlĚ_nder traveled the next two years in Germany before Panofsky secured a temporary position for him at he University of Pennsylvania and at New York University's new Institute of Fine Arts. He and another German refugee, <a href=""/lehmannk"">Karl Lehmann</a>, were given permanent appointments at NYU. In 1939, his catalog on Poussin drawings began appearing (through 1974). His articles on mannerism and anti-mannerism were translated by his students, (Mahonri S. Young and others), and circulated widely in mimeographed copies. FriedlĚ_nder retired in 1942 to <em>emeritus</em> status. He divorced in 1943; he continued to be productive, advising students and writing until his death. His students translated <u>Von David bis Delacroix</u> in 1952 as <u>From David to Delacroix</u>. In 1955, FriedlĚ_nder's last book, <u>Caravaggio Studies</u>, appeared. It had started as a larger work on the artist during FriedlĚ_nder's Freiburg years. His articles on the anti-classical and post-Mannerism, again, translated by his students, appeared in 1957. His papers were donated to the Leo Baeck Institute for the Study of the History of Culture of German-speaking Jewry. FriedlĚ_nder's students included the modernists <a href=""/goldwaterr"">Robert Goldwater</a>, <a href=""/brownm"">Milton Brown</a>, and <a href=""/rosenblumr"">Robert Rosenblum</a>; in his own subject area, students included <a href=""/coolidgej"">John P. Coolidge</a>, <a href=""/harttf"">Frederick Hartt</a>, <a href=""/costelloj"">Jane Costello</a>, <a href=""/gilbertc"">Creighton Gilbert</a>, <a href=""/huemerf"">Frances Huemer</a>, <a href=""/cahnw"">Walter Cahn</a> and <a href=""/posnerd"">Donald Posner</a>.  FriedlĚ_nder's reputation as an art historian is uneven. Methodologically he employed a largely formalist approach to his history which remained unaffected by other emerging methods, though he was capable of criticizing WĚ¦lfflin's work such as <u>Classic Art</u>. FriedlĚ_nder was among those art historians who rejected the notion of Italian Mannerism as a degenerate style, even eschewing the term ""Mannerism"" itself. He formulated the boundaries of Mannerism (""anti-classicism"") as beginning around 1520 and generating a second wave around 1550. Posthumously published volumes of his catalog of Poussin drawings were significantly changed by its editors, <a href=""/wittkowerr"">Rudolf Wittkower</a>, who disagreed with FriedlĚ_nder's decisions on autograph works, and <a href=""/blunta"">Anthony Blunt</a>, who was working on a Poussin book of his own. His volume on Caravaggio revised the artist's reputation to underscore Caravaggio's religious seriousness. He refused to credit formally the work of his New York University students in his books (<u>Caravaggio Studies</u> for example), except for dedication to them.",Germany;USA,"[complete bibliography, except for early newspaper exhibition reviews:] <u>Festschrift Walter Friedlaender zum 90.

Gaertner was the son of Carl Eugen Gaertner (1884-1937) and Fanny Hurwitz (Gaertner). Though his mother was Jewish, he was raised a Christian. Gaertner received his doctorate in theology from the University in Heidelberg in 1936, writing a dissertation on Johann Gottfried Herder's position on Christian art. His intent was to become a Christian minister. Despite being half Jewish, Gaertner was eligible for conscription in the German army. To avoid this, he emigrated to Peru immediately after graduation. There he met and married a Jewish refugee, also from Berlin, Gerda Meyer (1916-2004), a fashion designer, in 1941. The coupled lived in the South American country until the end of the World War II where Gaertner worked as a private language tutor in Lima and subsequently for a book importer. He and his wife moved to the United States in 1946, initially settling in New York working for a book publisher. He was sponsored in the United States by the director of the Boston Athenaem, Walter Muir Whitehill (1905-1978), through a mutual interest in Latin. Gaertner was hired at Lafayette College in Easton PA in 1947, initially as the Latin teacher. He parlayed his skills in the small college to teaching a variety of humanities courses of the years. He published poetry in Latin and German between 1954 and 1964. At Lafayette, Gaertner instituted the first art history courses, a single one-term class. He was promoted to associate professor in 1958.

Students inspired by Gaertner included the Yale University art historian Jules Prown (q.v.). He died at a local hospital at age 83. Gaertner was characteristic of many one-person art history departments in the second half of the 20th Century in the United States. He taught all areas of art as a way to bring cultural studies to a small college.

780,"Gerson, Horst",1907,"Berlin, Germany",1978,"Groningen, Netherlands","Rembrandt scholar and authority on Netherlandish art, Director, Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie and professor of art history at Groning University. Gerson's father was a medical doctor in Berlin. His mother, Gertrud Lilienfeld (d. 1943), was the sister of art historian Karl Lilienfeld (q.v.). After initially studying the history of art in Vienna and Berlin, Gerson settled in The Hague in 1928 as an assistant to Hofstede de Groot (q.v.), who his uncle had also assisted. He chose the scholars at the university in GĚ¦ttingen, the phenomenological esthetics of Moritz Geiger (1880-1937) and the art history of Count Vitzthum von EckstĚ_dt (q.v.), Wolfgang Stechow (q.v.) and Nikolaus Pevsner (q.v.) to complete his doctorate. Vitzthum supervised his dissertation in 1932 on the Dutch landscape painter Philips Koninck. Gerson and Hans Gronau (q.v.) were among Vitzthum's best students. Because of the increasing discrimination against Jews in Germany, he returned to The Hague. There, in the same year, 1932, he began his career at the Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie, an institution founded by his former mentor, Hofstede de Groot, who had died in 1930. He married Ilse Nehrkorn in 1935. His dissertation was published in 1936. He received his Netherlandish citizenship just before the German invasion in 1940. At the Rijksbureau, he worked first under Hans Schneider (q.v.), then Jan van Gelder (q.v.) and Ary B. de Vries (q.v.). His work assisting the difficult Abraham Bredius (q.v.) with his Rembrandt <i>catalogue raisonnĚ©</i>, developed in him a critical and independent eye, separating the paintings of Rembrandt from those which were incorrectly attributed to the master, and resulting in a life-long interest in the investigation and documentation of the Rembrandt-oeuvre. In 1942 he published his important book, <u>Ausbreitung und Nachwirkung der hollĚ_ndischen Malerei des 17. Jahrhunderts</u>,1942. Beginning in 1951, he published the first of three survey books of Netherlandish painting (Hals, Rembrandt and Vermeer, and van Gogh) in a ten-year stretch. In 1954 he assumed the directorship of the Rijksbureau. Gerson also had a great admiration for Flemish painting. He especially enjoyed the Flemish section at the Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie, evident from his contribution to the <u>Pelican History of Art</u> (series) volume, which he co-authored with E. H. ter Kuile (q.v.), <u>The Art and Architecture in Belgium</u> in 1960. In this period he acted as one of the co-editors of <u>Kindlers Malerei Lexicon</u>, also contributing a number of articles. In 1965 he was succeeded at the Rijksbureau by Sturla Gudlaugsson (q.v.). From 1965 to 1975, Gerson lectured as professor in History of Art at the University of Groningen, succeeding Henk Schulte Nordholt (q.v.). The following year he added to his duties the Head of the Art-Historical Institute. His 1966 inaugural lecture, ""De taal van de kunsthistorikus,"" (The Art Historian's Language) criticized Johan Huizinga (q.v.) as a cultural historian unwilling to see art history as a stand-alone discipline. He validated Huizinga's belief that art history writing was undermined by ""guiding principles"" or the imposition of overarching theories. His long research into autograph Rembrandt works culminated in his 1968 <u>Rembrandt Paintings</u> as well as a daring (and contested) revision of Bredius' Rembrandt-catalogue (1969), which reduced the works of the master from 639 to 419, or even fewer. He returned to the topic of Huizinga in 1972 for the lectures ""Johan Huizinga und die Kunstgeschichte"" (Huizinga and art history), whose work he overall supported and admired. Gerson resigned in 1975 in order to revise his <u>Ausbreitung</u> book. However, he died suddenly at age 71 without completing it. A Horst Gerson lecture series was established in his memory at the University of Groningen. Gerson was at heart a connoisseur-style scholar--learned from his mentor Hofstede de Groot--but one who blended an appreciation of documents, iconography, <i>Geistesgeschichte</i> and the Warburg Institute's conceptual-style art history into a cohesive method. Like any synthesizer, he attracted critics from all sides. Max FriedlĚ_nder (q.v.) a connoisseur of a generation before, paid Gerson the back-handed compliment by quipping that of all the people he rejected, Gerson was the least aggregious (""Von allen die verneinen, ist mir der Gerson noch am wenigsten zur Last""). If an older generation found him too willing to reject attributions, a younger generation found him not vigorous enough (van Gelder). The main goal of his teaching was to familiarize his students with the evaluation of style and the esthetic value of works of art (K. G. Boon). In his obituary, J. G. van Gelder noted tactfully that his ideas on connoisseurship did not allow for teamwork.",Germany;Netherlands,"Bazin, Germain. <u>Histoire de l'histoire de l'art; de Vasari ĚĘ nos jours</u>.

803,"Glaser, Curt",1879,"Leipzig, Saxony, Germany",1943,"Lake Placid, NY, USA","Art museum and library director; Germanist art historian specializing in northern renaissance; patron of Expressionist artist and Asian art authority. Glaser was born of cultured Jewish parentage, S. Glaser and Emma Hase (Glaser). He attended the Wilhelms gymnasium in Berlin, graduating in 1897. Glaser studied medicine at the University of Freiburg and Munich, receiving his M.D. in 1902. However, art had always interested him and he immediately began a second degree in art history during the years <a href=""/wolfflinh"">Heinrich WĚ¦lfflin</a> was in Berlin. He was granted a Ph.D. in art history under WĚ¦lfflin in 1907 writing his dissertation on Hans Holbein. In 1909 Glaser was appointed curator of the prints and drawings division (Kupferstichkabinett) at the Berlin Museum (Staatliche Museen Berlin). He spent the year 1912 on a study trip in Europe and Asia. When World War I was declared, Glaser served in the military as an army doctor. He married Elsa Kolker, daughter of the Ambassador Hugo Kolker, converted to protestant Christianity, and received considerable income from the family properties. His <u>Die Graphik der Neuzeit vom Anfang des XIX. Jahrhunderts bis zur Gegenwart</u> of 1922 helped to establish the artists he supported. In 1924 he was appointed director of the newly reconstituted (Prussian) State art library, which had separated from the Staatliche Museen in 1894. Glaser was a major supporter of the Weimar Republic and its art activities. He became a partner in the art gallery run by the publisher Paul Cassirer (1871-1926) and the art historian <a href=""/schefflerk"">Karl Scheffler</a>. The Glasers also became significant modern art collectors and patrons, including the artists Edvard Munch and Max Beckmann. Glaser himself created an early collection of Japanese graphics. In 1925 he published the volume on Asian sculpture for the monographic series <u>Kunst des Ostens</u> (Art of the East). Numerous portraits of Elsa Glaser were done by major modernist artists. The couple became influential art <i>cognoscenti</i> whose friends included other art historians such as <a href=""/swarzenskih"">Hanns Swarzenski</a> and artists such as Henri Matisse and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner. The Glaser home on the Prinz-Albrecht Strasse became a meeting point for art intellectuals. In 1933 the Nazis succeeded to power in Germany. The implementation of the ""Gesetzes zur Wiederherstellung des Berufsbeamtentums,"" the law which forbade Jews from holding civil servant positions, forced Glaser to leave the art library and disperse his art collection (Max Perl, dealer, May 1933). The Gestapo confiscated their home. Glaser remarried Maria Milch (later Maria Glaser-Ash) (b. 1901) and fled to Switzerland. The couple settled in Florence. After World War II was declared and Italy became part of the Axis powers, Glaser emigrated to New York, where he died at age 64. Together with <a href=""/dieze"">Ernst Diez</a> and <a href=""/grossee"">Ernst Grosse</a>, Glaser established the theoretic foundation for Asian art in the German-speaking world (Metzler).

814,"Goldschmidt, Adolph",1863,"Hamburg, Germany",1944,"Basel, Switzerland","Medievalist art historian, influential teacher to a generation of art historians and successor to Heinrich WĚ¦lfflin in Berlin. Goldschmidt was the eldest of seven children of wealthy Hamburg financier Martin Goldschmidt (1823-1903) and Louise Arnold (Goldschmidt) (1839-1919). He attended the Realgymnasium in Hamburg and then two years training in his father's office for a career in banking. Traveling to London the following year to learn international banking, Goldschmidt spent much of his time drawing and painting, preparing himself for university studies in the natural sciences or art. Upon his return to Germany in 1884, he began studies at the university in Jena, transferring to Kiel in 1886 and finally to Leipzig, the few universities to offer a degree in art history. At Leipzig he studied under <a href=""/springera"">Anton Springer</a>, completing his dissertation under him at the university in LĚ_beck on medieval painting and sculpture in 1889. Goldschmidt's fellow art history students at LĚ_beck included <a href=""/friedlanderm"">Max J. FriedlĚ_nder</a>, <a href=""/paulig"">Gustav Pauli </a>and <a href=""/clemenp"">Paul Clemen</a>, all of whom would become important art historians. After his dissertation, Goldschmidt traveled in Belgium, France, England and the Netherlands gathering material for his habilitation on the twelfth-century manuscript, the Albani Psalter. In France he me Wilhelm VĚ¦ge (q.v.), the other major German medievalist of his generation and himself a recent Ph.D. He taught at Berlin as a <em>Privatdozent</em>, 1892-1903, the first medievalist to teach art history there. Although as a <em>Privatdozent</em> he could not officially supervise dissertations, he essentially did it anyway, inspiring the work of students <a href=""/haseloffa"">Arthur Haseloff </a>and <a href=""/swarzenskig"">Georg Swarzenski</a>, both of whom also became prominent medievalists. In Berlin he met <a href=""/wolfflinh"">Heinrich WĚ¦lfflin</a> who was teaching at the University; the two developed a strong friendship. As a researcher whose method was rooted in studying the object and its documents, Goldschmidt developed fast friendships with museum curators <a href=""/bodew"">Wilhelm von Bode</a> and renewed his acquaintance with Bode's curatorial assistant, VĚ¦ge. Goldschmidt was made Extraordinarius professor in Berlin in 1903. The following year accepted a call to establish a department of art history at the university in Halle and assume a rank of Ordinarius professor. The Halle years, 1904-1912, were spent developing the department and recruiting students. He supervised an astounding forty-two doctoral candidates at Halle, among whom included <a href=""/jantzenh"">Hans Jantzen</a>, <a href=""/homburgero"">Otto Homburger</a>, <a href=""/oldenbourgr"">Rudolf Oldenbourg</a>, <a href=""/burchardl"">Ludwig Burchard</a>, <a href=""/noackw"">Werner Noack</a> and <a href=""/giesauh"">Hermann Giesau</a>. His Halle tenure also established the so-called Goldschmidt school of art history. Goldschmidt's interest in art spanned all periods. In addition to supervising dissertations in baroque, renaissance and medieval topics, he took a strong interest in the contemporary arts of Halle and Thuringia, advocating purchase of contemporary art by the city. In 1908 he helped found the Deutscher Verein fĚ_r Kunstwissenschaft, the group responsible for a national inventory of monuments in Germany. When WĚ¦lfflin left Berlin in 1912 for the University in Munich, he arranged for his former colleague Goldschmidt to replace him. His position at Halle was filled by <a href=""/waetzoldtw"">Wilhelm Waetzoldt</a>, who had also studied under Goldschmidt. At Berlin, Goldschmidt expanded the Art History Institute there, supervising another fifty-four dissertations until his retirement in 1932. Among the eminent scholars who wrote their theses under Goldschmidt during the Berlin years were <a href=""/galle"">Ernst Gall</a>, <a href=""/dornera"">Alexander Dorner</a>, <a href=""/boecklera"">Albert BĚ¦ckler</a>, <a href=""/neumeyera"">Alfred Neumeyer</a>, <a href=""/wittkowerr"">Rudolf Wittkower</a>, <a href=""/meyere"">Erich Meyer</a>, <a href=""/middeldorfu"">Ulrich Middeldorf</a>, and <a href=""/weitzmannk"">Kurt Weitzmann</a>. In addition, Goldschmidt supervised post-doctoral work of <a href=""/panofskye"">Erwin Panofsky</a>, <a href=""/kauffmannh"">Hans Kauffmann</a> and <a href=""/paatzw"">Walter Paatz</a>. In 1914 Goldschmidt issued the first of his three inventories of medieval ivories in the western world, an art form whose objects were widely scattered and poorly documented. Goldschmidt's profile among English-speaking scholars and collectors also rose. Scholarly exchanges between Harvard's <a href=""/portera"">A. Kingsley Porter</a> and <a href=""/sachsp"">Paul J. Sachs</a> led to two sabbaticals teaching there, making him the first German art historian to visit the United States after World War I. These occurred in the 1927-1928 year and again in 1930-1931. In 1926 and 1932 he wrote two of the volumes for the corpus <a href=""/hamannr"">Richard Hamann</a> was issuing on bronze doors. At the same time, Goldschmidt issued his two-volume examination of Carolingian and Ottonian manuscript illumination <u> Die deutsche Buchmalerei</u>. He retired in 1932. Goldschmidt was welcomed in the United States and through his friendship with <a href=""/cookw"">Walter S. Cook</a> returned again in 1936-1937 to teach at New York University. He also lectured at Princeton, Yale, Harvard, Wellesley College, the Morgan Library and Cleveland Museum of Art. He was instrumental in recommending a fellow German-Jewish art historian fleeing Nazi Germany, <a href=""/rosenbergj"">Jacob Rosenberg</a>, to Harvard. The mounting Nazi pressure in Germany to dismiss Jews from positions of leadership hit Goldschmidt particularly hard. A patriotic German who had worked his life to elucidate the monuments of his own country, he resisted emigration until he was no longer permitted to use the university library. In 1939 he moved to Basel, Switzerland, with the aid of collector Robert von Hirsch (1883-1977) where he died in 1944.  Goldschmidt was one of the founders of the modern study of medieval monuments, basing his method upon scientific observation and comparison of monuments from first-hand experience. Employing a methodology of iconography and formal analysis, he taught or inspired nearly all the major medievalists of the latter twentieth century. He railed against the prevalent metaphysical interpretation of art, and in particular the work of WĚ¦lfflin. Style and appearance were not, Goldschmidt insisted, the result of a predetermined impulse of the age in which they were created. Panofsky described Goldschmidt's accomplishment as ""the precise solution of precisely formulated problems and the study of monuments that was at once detailed and comprehensive."" His dedication to the genre of the corpus was indicative both of his level of scholarship and in his willingness to create tools for future generations. His work was refined later in the twentieth century by <a href=""/weitzmannk"">Kurt Weitzmann</a> and <a href=""/volbachw"">W. F.

Gombrich grew up within one of the elite cultural circles of Vienna. His father, Karl Gombrich (1874-1950), was the vice-president of the Disciplinary Council of the Austrian Bar, and his mother, Leonie Hock (Gombrich) (1873-1968), was a pianist who had studied under the composer Anton Bruckner (1824-1896) and taught piano to Gustav Mahler's sister. Gombrich himself was an accomplished cellist. The family had originally been Jewish but converted to Lutheranism at the turn of the 20th century. Gombrich himself never claimed any religious affiliation. As a child immediately after World War I, when starvation in Austria was widespread, he and his sister, Lisbeth, were sent by the Save the Children (organization) to live with families in Sweden for nine months in 1920. Returning to Vienna, Gombrich was attended the Theresianum secondary school where at age 14 he wrote an essay on the ways art appreciation had changed from Winckelmann to the present. His interest in art history affirmed, Gombrich entered the University of Vienna in 1928 where he studied under the so-called Vienna School art historians, <a href=""/tietzeh"">Hans Tietze</a>, <a href=""/swobodak"">Karl Maria Swoboda</a>, and <a href=""/schlosserj"">Julius von Schlosser</a>, the latter with whom he wrote his dissertation was on the Mannerist architecture of Giulio Romano. Never happy to be the disciple of only one scholar, Gombrich also attended lectures by <a href=""/strzygowski"">Josef Strzygowski</a>, Schlosser's egotistical arch rival, at the competing Wiener Institut in Vienna. Gombrich's Viennese colleagues during this time also included <a href=""/kurzo"">Otto Kurz</a>, who years later taught with Gombrich at the Warburg Institute. While researching his dissertation on the Palazzo del Te in Mantua, he corresponded with a friend's young daughter about his work. The publisher Walter Neurath (1903-1967) convinced him to turn this into a book of world history for children, <u>Weltgeschichte fĚ_r Kinder</u>, 1936. Gombrich did this in part because the economy and anti-semitic government made an academic position difficult to find. He also occupied his time learning Chinese. Through Schlosser, Gombrich met the museum curator and psychoanalyst <a href=""/krise"">Ernst Kris</a>. Together they authored a book on caricature (eventually published in a much abbreviated form in 1940). Kris introduced Gombrich to <a href=""/saxlf"">Fritz Saxl</a>, the director of the Warburg Institute in London (where it had moved from Hamburg in 1933). Kris recommended Gombrich to the Warburg, who assigned him a two-year fellowship in 1936, assisting <a href=""/bingg"">Gertrud Bing</a> in preparing the papers of its founder, <a href=""/warburga"">Aby Warburg</a> for publication. The same year he married Ilse ""Lonnie"" Heller (b. 1910), a Czech concert pianist and pupil of the pianist Rudolf Serkin (1903-1991). The Holocaust fully under way, Gombrich assisted his parents to escape Vienna in 1938 shortly before the beginning of World War II. He moved to the newly-founded Courtauld Institute when the Warburg lost its temporary lodgings at Thames House. Between 1938 and 1939 he lectured weekly on Giorgio Vasari. With Kurz, he began collaborating on a book on iconography, which was never published because of the outbreak of the World War II. During the War, Gombrich worked intercepting and translating foreign radio broadcasts for the BBC at Evesham, England. He also published an essay on Poussin in <u>The Burlington Magazine</u>, maintaining his connections with the Warburg Institute, which had been incorporated by London University in 1944. He returned to Warburg in 1946 as a senior research fellow named by Saxl. After Saxl's death in 1948, Saxl's successor, <a href=""/frankforth"">Henri Frankfort</a>, appointed Gombrich a Lecturer at the Warburg (to 1954). Gombrich wrote his famous study of Botticelli's Primavera, an essay associating the ideas of the Neoplatonic philosopher Marsilio Ficino with the Botticelli painting. After the War, he resumed his work editing Warburg's papers. Phaidon Press founder Bela Horovitz (1898-1955) convinced him to rewrite a general textbook of art, akin to his <u>Weltgeschichte</u> which had he had begun in 1937. The result was <u>The Story of Art</u> (1950), ostensibly written for teenagers, but which had a huge impact on the general post-war populace. He was named the Slade Chair at Oxford University, 1950-1953, and Durning-Lawrence Professor at University College, London, 1956-1969. Gombrich always retained a position at the Warburg, Reader, between 1954-1956 and Special Lecturer from 1956-1959. In 1956, too, Gombrich delivered the Mellon lectures in Washington, DC, called ""Art and Illusion."" This appeared in book form in 1960. <u>Art and Illusion</u> laid the framework for a psychological understanding of art to a wider public. He became director of the Warburg in 1959. As director, he reorganized the institute, encouraging its scholars, who now included <a href=""/wittkowerr"">Rudolf Wittkower</a>, <a href=""/buchthalh"">Hugo Buchthal</a> and Kurz, to teach as well as research. He also launched a lecture series bringing in outside speakers. He was Visiting Professor of Fine Art at Harvard University in 1959, returning to be named Professor of the History of Classical Tradition at London University in 1959, which he held to 1976. Between 1961 and 1963 he was Slade Professor of Fine Art at Cambridge, and in 1967, became Lethaby Professor at the Royal College of Art, 1967-1968. His collected essays on art appreciation, <u>Meditations on a Hobby Horse</u> appeared in 1968. <u>Symbolic Images: Studies in the Art of the Renaissance</u>, 1972, discussed the historical importance of forms of symbolism. Gombrich was appointed Andrew D. White Professor-at-Large, Cornell University, from 1970 to 1977. During that time he was knighted (1972) and delivered the Romanes Lecture at Oxford University, ""Art History and the Social Sciences,"" 1975. In 1979 he returned to questions of perception and representation in his Wrightsman Lectures, published as <u>A Sense of Order</u>, a collaboration with the neuropsychologist Richard Gregory. Gombrich was appointed a member of the Order of Merit in 1988. His students include <a href=""/podrom"">Michael Podro</a> and <a href=""/baxandallm"">Michael Baxandall</a>. His son, Richard Gombrich (b. 1937), has been Boden Professor of Sanskrit at Oxford University since 1976. Gombrich's unique approach to art history began with his dissertation, written under Schlosser, on the Mannerist architect and painter Guilio Romano. Mannerism in the 1930s was considered a deliberate distortion of the ideals of the Renaissance (and often compared to the Expressionism of Germany in their century). Schlosser himself had written on it. Gombrich asserted that the eccentricities of Giulio's Mannerist style, far from being degenerate, were employed for a patron eager for fashionable novelty. Throughout his career, Gombrich avoided using the prevailing methods of art history, connoisseurship and attribution, remarking that they were ""very much on the fringe of [his] formation"" (Kimmelman). He characterized most of art criticism as simply the critic's emotional response to art. Parallels have been drawn between Gombrich's melding of art history with psychology to that of the philosopher Karl Popper's psychology and the history of science. Gombrich publicly claimed a debt to his friend, Popper, assisting Popper in the preparation of Popper's manuscript of <u>The Open Society and its Enemies</u>,1945. Although Gombrich wrote about Picasso and modern artists, he had little affinity for contemporary art. His essay ""The Vogue of Abstract Art"" (reprinted in <u>Meditations</u>) denounced American action painting, as a ""visual fad"" supported by dealers rather than ideas. Elsewhere he wrote skeptically about Schoenberg's 12-tone system. Many of Gombrich's theories on art were drawn from his rich life experiences. As radio translator of Nazi broadcasts during World War II, he frequently had to glean words from faint transmissions. Later, in <u>Art and Illusion</u>, he wrote that ""you had to know what might be said in order to hear what was said."" This concept, which he called ""making and matching,"" was crucial, he claimed, to how people perceive images. His interpretation of Cubism criticized the movement as ""the most radical attempt to stamp out ambiguity and to enforce one reading of the picture."" Gombrich was comfortable as an iconographer, identifying in the practice of iconology two currents: the neo-Platonic, mystical (e.g., <a href=""/panofskye"">Erwin Panofsky</a>) and the Aristotelian, rhetorical function (code of signs) (Bazin). It was his survey, <u>The Story of Art</u>, however, that established Gombrich's popular reputation. While most surveys had been little more than long lists of names, dates and discussions styles, Gombrich focused on the problems which artists at different periods had solved. Methodologically, he was particularly opposed to Marxist approaches to art (see Gombrich's discussion of the approach in the entry on <a href=""/hausera"">Arnold Hauser</a>), Hegelian world views, or doctrines, such as <i>Weltanschauung</i> (Spirit of the Age"") that embraced cultural relativism or collectivizations of art. ""We should not go off on a tangent but rather learn as much as we can about the painter's craft,"" he declared. Gombrich was a charismatic lecturer, surprising audiences with images from magazine advertisements or Saul Steinberg cartoons in between projections of paintings of Old Masters. Not all of Gombrich's writings have wholly been accepted. His assertion of a link between Renaissance art and the philosophical doctrines, stated in the Botticelli Primavera article, have been doubted, even later by Gombrich himself, in the introduction to <u>Symbolic Images</u> (1972). Gombrich's initial assignment at the Warburg Library in London was to ready Warburg's papers for publication. He astutely realized that Warburg's notes were not suitable for publication because of the juxtaposing way Warburg worked (see entry on Warburg) and Warburg's inability to draw lucid conclusions. Gombrich used his study of Warburg to write an intellectual biography of Warburg (1970, 2nd ed., 1985), which is by far the best introduction to Warburg's ideas.",Austria;UK,"Kleinbauer, W.

828,"Gosebruch, Ernst",1872,"Essen, Germany",1953,"Munich, Germany","Director, Essener Kunstmuseum 1909-1922, major exhibitor of German Expressionism. Between 1891 and 1896 Gosebruch studied philology in Munich, Geneva and Berlin. He taught as a private tutor until 1903 when he joined the the Essen museum as an unpaid assistant. During the same time he studied art history in Paris and Berlin, the latter venue under Heinrich WĚ¦lfflin (q.v.). After a second undergraduate degree in art history in 1906, he was appointed in 1909 Director of Essen art museums, a diverse art collection. To this conglomeration, Gosebruch began purchasing modernist art, including a van Gogh, and mounting an exhibition on Emil Nolde. When the seminal collector and museum-founder of modern art, Karl Ernst Osthaus (q.v.) died in 1921, the city fathers purchased his musuem, the Folkwang, in Hagen, Germany moving it to Essen. Gosebruch became the first [Essen] Folkwang Museum director, following Osthaus' lead in acquisitions. Between 1922 and 1933 Gosebruch created one of the most famous museums in Germany solely devoted to modern art. He became friends with with the Expressionist artists, particularly <em>Die BrĚ_cke</em> artists, Christian Rohlfs, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and Erich Heckel. A new building was constructed between 1925-1929. The massive inflation of the Weimar Republic limited much of the design, however. Gosebruch wanted German artists to be in charge of the decoration. A painting in the fountain area was completed by Oskar Schlemmer, but another project, planned for Kirchner, was financially impossible and Kirchner and Gosebruch fell ou on the matter. As a curator, Gosebruch hung exhibitions without regard to historic periods. Gosebruch developed a strong friendship with Max Sauerlandt (q.v.). The collapse of the Weimar Republic fostered a hate campaing against Gosebruch, fostered by the <em>Kampfbund fĚ_r Deutsche Kulture</em> (Activists Society for German Culture). Because of the museum government, it was impossible to dismiss Gosebruch as the Reich had done with other museum directors, but pressure on Gosebruch forced him to retire early. Living on a pension in LĚ_beck, he watched while his successor, Klaus Graf Baudissin (q.v.), a Nazi hack, dismantled the collection. More than 1000 works were confiscated by the Nazis, who declared the pieces ""Degenerate Art."" After the war Gosebruch lived in Munich. The Folkwang Museum assiduously bought back much of the collection after the War. His son, Martin Gosebruch (q.v.) was also an art historian. Gosebruch was one of a handful of art historians and collectors who brought modern art to Germany, whose numbers included Hugo von Tschudi (q.v.) in Berlin and Munich, Harry Graf Kestler (q.v.) in Weimar, and Osthaus. He mounted shows with the modernist art dealer Alfred Flechtheim. ",Germany,"Gemmecke, Claudia.

Gronau was born at his family's villa, San Domenico, near Fiesole, the son of the future Cassel GemĚ_ldegalerie Director, Georg Gronau (q.v.). At age six his family left Italy when his father was appointed director of the GemĚ_ldegalerie in Cassel, Germany. His older brother was killed in World War I. He was not initially interested in art scholarship and took a job with an art dealer in Berlin. However, after his return with the family to the villa in 1929, he began reading in the personal library of Bernard Berenson (q.v.) at I Tatti and the Kunsthistorisches Institut where his father was involved in research. He became interested in art scholarship, returning to Germany the same year to study at GĚ¦ttingen under Wolfgang Stechow (q.v.), and Wilhelm Pinder (q.v.) in Munich, and then finally under Count Georg Vitzthum von EckstĚ_dt (q.v.) in GĚ¦ttingen. He began publishing in English (<u>Burlington Magazine</u>) also in 1929. He received his Ph. D. <i>summa cum laude</i> in 1934, writing his dissertation on Andrea Orcagna and Nardo di Cione. The Cioni would be a life-long interest of his. His intent was, like his father, to direct a museum. However, after his wife, the art historian Carmen von Wogau (1910-1999), whom he married in 1935, witnessed a speech by Hitler, she convince Gronau to move to London, where they had relatives, the same year. He found work as an advisor to an art dealer, publishing a version of this dissertation in Germany in 1937. When England declared war on Germany, Gronau was briefly interned on the Isle of Man, but released. To escape from the Blitz, his family fled to Beckley Manor in Oxfordshire. He pressed to join the British army and was eventually commissioned (after two rejections on medical grounds) to the the Pioneer Corps. After the war, he became a British citizen and joined Sotheby's in 1945 as an advisor, succeeding Tancred Borenius (q.v.), who was no longer deemed reliable in attributions. Sotheby's was still largely known for its book auctions, not painting; the firm was intent to become on a par with Christies. The hiring of Gronau gave the firm a noted art connoisseur and allowed Gronau the chance to devote his energies more to art scholarship, publishing the bulk of his articles during this period of his life. He lectured at the Courtauld Institute on Giotto and the Florentine school. In 1950 he was diagnosed with a congenital heart condition, which precluded him from lifting paintings or climbing stairs. His wife, Carmen, began to assume the duties at Sotheby's he could not longer perform. He was at work on a catalog of the Italian paintings in the Fitzwilliam Collection when he died at age 46. His two sons also died in the forties of the same ailment. Gronau's wife assumed his position at Sotheby's and, with its Chair, Peter Wilson, built the firm into the major art auction firms of the 1970s and 1980s.One of Grounau's interests was in reconstructions of multi-panel art works.

As a student at the Wiener Handelsakademie he met <a href=""/seilerundaspanga"">Antoine (later Count) Seilern</a> who would prove instrumental in his later career. He graduated in 1920, continuing study in art history at the universities in Jura and then Vienna focusing on German philology and art history.

During this time, too, a close friendship with the Vienna-School art historians, particularly <a href=""/novotnyf"">Fritz Novotny</a> and Tietze led to his championing of contemporary Viennese artists. Many were part of the Hagenbund or connected to the Zinkenbacher Malerkolonie on the Wolfgangsee, including Georg and Bettina Erhlich, Gerhart Frankl, Georg Merkel, Theodor Fried, Lisel Salzer, Lois Pregartbauer, and Franz von Zulow. Grossmann taught as a lecturer in the Volkhochschule, Vienna, taking part in their Art History (Urania) promotion program as well as delivering regular broadcasts on art history on Radio Vienna. Beginning in 1930 he was the Austrian Editor of the Czech magazine for contemporary art, <u>Forum</u>, and also a contributor to <u>Belvedere</u> and <u>Kirchenkunst</u>. He married Anny Zach in 1932 (d. 1985). He revised GlĚ_ck's on Pieter Bruegel the Elder publishing it in English in 1936. In December 1938, as a result of the Anschluss, Grossmann, of Jewish ancestry, was forced to leave Vienna.

Grossmann wrote his first article for the Burlington Magazine in 1944. Grossmann reconnected with Count Seilern, also in England, who was building one of the most spectacular art collections in England. Grossmann assisted Seilern in compiling the catalog of his collection. In 1955 Grossmann published his book on Pieter Bruegel the Elder, <u>Bruegel: The Paintings, Complete Edition</u>. The following year he edited a revised translation of the 1916 <u>Von Eyck bis Bruegel</u> by of <a href=""/friedlanderm"">Max FriedlĚ_nder</a>. In 1960, he moved to the Manchester City Art Gallery where he became Deputy Director. Exhibitions mounted by Grossmann included Wenceslas Hollar (1961) and Mannerist Art (1965) as well as the re-installation of the Assheton-Bennet collections in the Gallery. His retirement in 1967 brought a call as Visiting (and later Emeritus) Professor of Art History from the University of Washington, Seattle. After his retirement from Washington in 1972, he settled in Dulwich, London. In 1978 Count Seiler donated his collection to the Courtauld Gallery and National Gallery as the ""Prince's Gate Collection"" because he preferred to remain anonymous.  Grossmann's work on Breughel began with an expansion of GlĚ_ck's work on the artist (Moore). Grossmann became a major authority on the artist. He contributed articles to the <u>Burlington Magazine</u> until 1973, writing important articles on Holbein, Bruegel and other Flemish artists as well as de la Tour. Though a scholar of broad knowledge, he published than he might have because of a circumspect and cautious approach to his material (Gombrich). His Bruegel book was so respected that it went through three published revisions (1966 and 1973).",Germany;USA,"Wendland, Ulrike. <u>Biographisches Handbuch deutschsprachiger Kunsthistoriker im Exil: Leben und Werk der unter dem Nationalsozialismus verfolgten und vertriebenen Wissenschaftler</u>.

He studied art history briefly at the university in Jena in 1912 before switching to architecture in Braunschweig (1912-1919), with time off for military service in the First World War. After the war he studied art history in Munich and then at Halle. He wrote his dissertation at Halle under Paul Frankl (q.v.) on the printmaker Georg Lemberger in 1922. In 1924 he accepted a position as a conservator (Landeskonservator) at the GemĚ_ldegalerie in Dessau, rising to director. He was a motivating force in the move of the Bauhaus to Dessau from Weimar. His connection with the Bauhaus resulted in his dismissal in 1933 by the Nazis at the ascension to power. Grote moved to Berlin where he taught privately and consulted. He was part of the circle of Berlin intellectuals that included Carl Georg Heise (q.v.), the cultural minister Theodor Heuss (1884-1963), and Leopold Reidemeister (q.v.). Despite his dismissal by the Nazi government, Grote fought for Germany as a soldier, assigned to the Eastern front. After the war Grote was an art dealer in Munich 1945-49.

Yvonne Hackenbroch was born into a religious, Jewish middle-class family of intellectual and artistic interests. Her father, Zacharias M. Hackenbroch (1884-1937), was an art dealer and her mother, Clementine Schwarzschild Hackenbroch (1888-1984), a descendent of the art dealer/expert Selig Goldschmidt (1795-1863). The family summered in the Medieval town of Miltenburg. Hackenbroch was fluent in French, English, German (the family languages) as well as Italian by the end of her childhood. Her earliest art writing began when her father and other dealers purchased the Guelph Treasures and she wrote a booklet on the collection. She studied art history at Munich University both as an undergraduate and post graduate under <a href=""/jantzenh"">Hans Jantzen</a> and <a href=""/pinderw"">Wilhelm Pinder</a>. The rise of Nazism in Germany made it impossible for Jews to attend universities or hold academic positions; Hackenbroch was the last Jew to gain a doctorate in Munich in December 1936. Her thesis, written under Jantzen, was on the topic of Italian medieval enamels. She traveled to Italy, but at her father's death in 1937, immigrated to London where her older sister (and later her mother) lived. Hackenbroch took a position with the British Museum during World War II, participating in the excavation and cataloging of the Sutton Hoo treasure. She was assigned as part of the detail to pack up and safely store the Museum's collection. Following the War, when Viscount Lee donated a Renaissance collection to Canada in appreciation of its assistance in the War, Hackenbroch acted on behalf of the British Government to expertise it in Toronto. Three years later she moved to New York and later became an American citizen. In New York she worked for Judge Irwin Untermyer, a Trustee and benefactor of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. At the donation of his gift of Renaissance objects, Hackenbroch was made a curator cataloging the collection. She published her work in catalogs and articles. In 1979 her book <u>Renaissance Jewellery</u> was published to acclaim, still considered the seminal work on the subject. In New York she regularly hosted in her apartment parties to bring together experts and students. She retired from the Museum and moved to London where her family lived in 1987. The University of Munich honored her with a FestSchrift. In retirement she researched in the libraries of the Warburg Institute, the Courtauld Collection and the British Museum producing a book on Enseignes - Renaissance Hat Jewels in 1996.

919,"Hartlaub, Gustav",1884,"Bermen, Germany",1963,"Heidelberg, Germany","Modernist art historian, coined the term ""Neue Sachlichkeit"" for the period of German art between the wars. Hartmann's paternal family were long merchant-entrepeurs in Bremen. After graduating from the gymnasium in Bremen, he attended classes beginning in 1904 at the universities of Freiburg, Vienna, Munich (Ludwig-Maximilians-UniversitĚ_t, Institut fĚ_r Kunstgeschichte under Berthold Riehl, q.v.) and eventually GĚ¦ttingen. He wrote his disssertation at GĚ¦ttingen under Robert Vischer (q.v.) on the topic of Sienese painting in the fifteenth century. After a travel year, he entered the Kunsthalle in Bremen as an assistant working in the prints collection, 1910-1913. His early scholarship focused on the Italian Renaissance. In 1913 Hartlaub was appointed a curator at the Mannheim Kunsthalle under Fritz Wichert (q.v.). His research now moved to Romantic period Germany and the 20th century. Hartlaub was deputy director of the museum during the war years 1914 through 1919. In 1923 he succeeded Wichert as director. In 1923 Hartlaub began using the term ""Neue Sachlichkeit"" (New Objectivity) to distinguish non-Expressionist art in Germany. He set out to show the most modern artists. His 1924 exhibition, ""Kubin und Klee"" was followed by one on the German Expressionist Karl Schmidt Rottluff, 1925. In 1926 by a show of the title ""Die neue Sachlichkeit"" at the Kunsthalle, a show traveling to Chemnitz and Dresden through 1927. The art was avant-garde enough for some museum directors to ask for works to be omitted, as in the case of Schreiber Wiegand (q.v.), in Chemnitz. During his tenure as director, Hartlaub hired Kurt Martin (q.v.) as part of the museum staff. Hartlaub actively purchased modern art by the Fauves, Expressionists and other modernist groups. The assumption of power by the Nazis in 1933 made Hartlaub an object of scorn for his support of modern art. The Mannheim museum became the first museum to have a Schandausstellung (Shame Exhibition) of modern art, preceeding the famous 1937 ""Entartete Kunst"" (degenerate art) show in Munich. At the Mannheim show, large photos of Hartlaub were paraded in the streets together with Chagall's ""Rabbi.""

931,"Hauser, Arnold",1892,"TemesvĚÁr, Hungary; [present day Romania]",1978,"Budapest, Hungary","Marxist film and art historian. As a student of German and Romance languages in Budapest, Hauser (in 1916) joined the <i>Sonntagskreis</i>, where his friend and colleague Karl Mannheim (1893-1947) and the philosopher George LukĚÁcs (1885-1971) were members. In 1918 Hauser received his doctorate in German romantic aesthetics, assumed a professorship at the University in Budapest, and became the Director of the <i>Reformrates</i> (Council on Reform) of art history education. Following the Hungarian Counterrevolution in 1919, Hauser fled to Italy, where he first studied fine art. From 1920-1925 he lived in Berlin, attending the lectures of Adolph Goldschmidt (q.v.) and the historian Ernst Troeltsch (1865-1923). Facing the expanding power of national socialism in Germany, Hauser moved to Vienna in 1925, where found employment as the promotions manager of a Viennese film company. During this time, he collected materials for his book, <u>Dramaturgie und Soziologie des Films</u>, which was never completed. He was also a member of the Austrian Film Censorship Advisory Board (<i>Filmzensurbeirat</i>) from 1933-36 and a docent of Film Theory and Technology at the Vienna <i>Volkshochschule (</i>community college). In 1938, Hauser fled to England to avoid Nazi persecution. Hauser wrote essays on film for the periodicals <u>Life and Letters Today</u> and <u>Sight and Sound</u>. At the request of his friend, Mannheim in 1941, he agreed to write an introduction to an anthology of the sociology of art. Over the course of ten years, working almost solely evenings and weekends, Hauser turned the assignment into his famous <u>Sozialgeschichte der Kunst und Literatur</u>, though first published in English <u>The Social History of Art</u>. The publication of the first volume in 1951 marked Hauser's entry into academics. He became a visiting professor at the University of Leeds (1951-1957) working concurrently on volume two of the <u>Social History</u> and another book, <u> Philosophy of Art History</u><i>.</i> After the theorist Theodor Adorno (1903-1969) invited him to lecture in Frankfurt, numerous German universities extended him additional invitations for him to lecture. In 1958 Hauser published the second volume of <u>The Social History of Art</u>. While a guest professor at Brandeis University (1957-59) he wrote a history of mannerism. He moved back to London in 1959 to lecture at Hornsey College of Art. His book on mannerism appeared in 1964. He published his third and final volume of <u>The Social History of Art</u> while serving as guest professor at the University of Ohio. Shortly before his death in 1978, Hauser returned to Budapest as an honorary member of the Hungarian Academy of Science. Hauser's <u>Social History of Art</u> opens without a methodological introduction, but rather launches immediately into the prehistory of art. At breakneck pace, Hauser traces the history of art up to the 20<sup>th</sup> century. He entitles the 20<sup>th</sup> century as the Era of Film and refers to Picasso as the representative artist of the time. Hauser's controversial methodology attracted many critics. He was criticized for paying scant attention to architecture and music, despite his personal attachment to both. The art historian Ernst Gombrich (q.v.) was most critical of Hauser, chiding him for failing to see the works for themselves, but rather observing them through the ""myopic lens"" of Hauser's theories. Gombrich, a critic of theoretical abstractions on art history in general--especially Hegelian--accused Hauser of a fantasy world that quickly caught one in the mousetrap of dialectical materialism. Hauser repeatedly turned to dialectical materialism to investigate the influence of societal and economic relationships on style, especially in respect to the tendency towards Naturalism and Rationalism. Hauser modified his Marxism to fit the humanities--particularly the prevailing history of artistic form and style of Alois Riegl (q.v.) and Heinrich WĚ¦lfflin (q.v.)--by examining the function of society and world view in art. His approach was a welcome break for many from the insular idealist and formalist methods. Hauser was forcefully attacked by orthodox Marxists for slighting class warfare. Hauser's response to this criticism was that, while he employed Marxism as a scientific method and hoped for a socialist society, he chose not to participate in the political struggle and could not identify with the example that the Soviet Union provided. Hauser first presented his theories on art history in <u>Philosophie der Kunstgeschichte</u><i>, </i> in particular<i> </i>in the chapter entitled ""Kunstgeschichte ohne Namen<i>.""</i> Hauser deliberates on Austrian and German scientific directions and their ideological histories with care. A noticeable omission is Aby Warburg (q.v.), who had fled Germany just as Hauser had. Hauser insisted that the main problematic (<i>Hauptproblem</i>) of art history concerned the origin and evolution of style (<i>Stilwandel/Stilbeginn</i>). In opposition to WĚ¦lfflin, Hauser identified a period by what he called its ""stylistic unity,"" the forced regularity of form development, and the periodic return of <i>Stilstufen</i> to fiction. In contrast to Alois Riegl (q.v.), Hauser argued that what was held in esteem differed from period to period, and that artists were not always completely autonomous in their renderings. The meaning and value of works were not fixed, Hauser argued, but rather were transformed by the works that followed. Hauser believed that in order to understand the evolution of style, one must turn to sociological rather than psychological and explanations. While holding high regard for the fields of psychology and depth psychology, Hauser chose to approach artistic style from a sociological perspective. He stressed the role of the individual in creation, something that had received growing attention since the Renaissance. Unlike many hard-line Marxist theorists, Hauser emphasized that while artistic forms are the expression of a societal <i>Weltanschauung</i> (worldview) they are not a direct reflection of economic and social circumstances. Style, Hauser argued, is not a wholly neutral tool, nor does it fulfill an explicit social function, but rather it could be subordinate to a variety of political and social goals.

Held's father was Adolf Held (1873-1919), employed as a merchant; his mother was Nannette Seligmann (1872-1926). He attended realprogymnasium in Mosbach and Gymnasium Heidelberg in that city, receiving his abitur in 1923. He entered the University of Heidelberg in 1923, studying also at Wilhelm Humbolt University, Berlin, 1923-24, 1927-28 and Vienna, 1925-26, 1929. His faculty included Adolph Goldschmidt (q.v.), Julius von Schlosser (q.v.), Oskar Fischel (q.v.) and Frederick Antal (q.v.). He received his Ph.D. from the University of Freiburg in 1930 under Hans Jantzen (q.v.) writing on a topic of DĚ_rer. He worked as an assistant to Antal, 1930-1931 and an unpaid assistant in the Berlin Museum in various departments, including the library, prints department (under Elfried Bock, q.v.) and the GemĚ_ldegalerie under Max FriedlĚ_nder (q.v.). He was dismissed from the Museum because of his Jewish heritage in 1933 and fled to the United States the following year. He returned briefly, a risky venture, to persuade his future wife to join him in the United States. In 1936 he married her, Ingrid-MĚ_rta Nordin-Petterssen (1905-1986), a Swedish citizen and art restorer. Beginning in 1935, Held lectured in art history at New York University until 1937 when he moved to Barnard College, the woman's college of Columbia University, in 1937. He was appointed assistant professor in 1944. He remain at Barnard, advancing to associate professor in 1950, the full professor 1954. During the 1950's he was asked by Luis Ferre, the Governor of Puerto Rico, to advise the new museum in Ponce, on baroque purchases. Held was able to assemble masterworks--including works of the 19th century such as Lord Leighton's <u>Flaming June</u>--making it the most important Caribbean art collection. Held maintained a strong student following at Barnard. His 1968 book <u>Rembrandt Studies</u>--written during the height of the student revolt when the very functions and goals of traditional scholarship"" were being questioned asserted the importance of art history. The following year <u>Rembrandt's Aristotle and other Rembrandt Studies</u> appeared, which included some of his most famous essays. In 1970 he published an article in the <u>Burlington Magazine</u> pointing out that five of the nine ceiling paintings by Rubens in the Banqueting House in Whitehall had been installed incorrectly. Their reinstallation by 180 degrees vindicated his scholarship. He retired from Barnard in 1971, teaching as visiting professor at Williams College 1972-1981 and at William's Clark Art Institute. At age 75 he issued what many considered his landmark study, his two-volume <u>Oil Sketches of Peter Paul Rubens</u> (1980). Held donated over 200 works of his collection of more than 1000 master drawings to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, in 1984. In 1988 he was instrumental in creating a memorial to the <i>Kristallnacht </i>razing of his boyhood synagogue in Mosbach. He died at his farm in Bennington, Vermont, at age 97. A 2006 session of the College Art Association was held entitled, ""Revisiting Julius S. Held."" Held's daughter, Anna Held Audette (b. 1938) was also a professor of art. His students included John Walsh (q.v.), David Rosand and Anne W. Lowenthal.Held's classical educational background allowed him to broaden the material considered for art history. His article on ""Rembrandt's Aristotle Contemplating the Bust of Homer,"" for example, incorporated the psychology of blindness for an artist (Rembrandt's father had been blind), in addition to the traditional story-line of the portrait. Held maintained the primacy of connoisseurship as one of the important tools of the art historian, at a time when the discipline was heavily favoring iconography and other more ""empirical"" methods of study.

980,"Hess, Jacob",1885,"Munich, Germany",1969,"Rome, Italy","Scholar of Italian Renaissance and Baroque art, particularly interested in artist biographies. Hess came to art history late in life, studying the discipline beginning only in 1919 at age 34. He studied under Heinrich WĚ¦lfflin (q.v.) in Munich and in Vienna under literary historian Karl Vossler (1872-1949) and Vienna School art historians Max Dvo�ŞĚÁk (q.v.) and Julius von Schlosser (q.v.). Though Hess wrote his dissertation under WĚ¦lfflin in Munich, it was Schlosser who ignited Hess' interest in Schlosser's field of the literary sources of art history. Hess' thesis, a study of biographies of Giovanni Passeri (q.v.), was accepted in 1926 and published in 1928. He remained in Munich, working on a scholarly facsimile edition of Passeri's <u>Vite</u>, <u>Die kĚ_nstlerbiographien von Giovanni Battista Passeri</u>, financed through a grant, which he published in 1934. The result of collating various manuscripts into a magisterial commentary, it is still unsurpassed. The vast anti-Semitism associated with the Nazi's rise to power forced Hess to leave Germany, moving to Rome the same year. Making use of a small grant from the Vatican Library, he began work on an edition of the <u>Vite</u> of Giovanni Baglione (q.v.). The following year, 1935, he privately issued his monograph on Agostino Tassi. When World War II erupted and Italy was no longer safe, Hess fled to London in 1939, supported at the Warburg Institute and financially assisted by Ellis Waterhouse (q.v.) and Richard Krautheimer (q.v.). He was interned as a German in 1940. After the war he returned to Rome in 1948, supported be grants from the Vatican Library. He was awarded compensation for persecution in 1950 by the German government. Beginning in 1953 he secured a Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft grant which allowed him to research independently. His house in Italy, Villa Ostia, became a meeting point for continental scholars of Italian art. A dedicated historiographer, he intended to have stucco portraits of his mentors painted on the walls of his dining room. Hess set about for his final life's project to write the authoritative commentary to the <u>Vite</u> of Giovanni Baglioni (q.v.). He got through the first three and a half <i>giornate</i>, in which the work was divided before he died at age 84. His research was brought to publication by Erwarth RĚ¦ttgen. In 1967 his collected studies, brought up to date by Hess himself, were published as Though Hess was a ""sources"" scholar, he was not particularly interested in unearthing primary documents. Rather he focused on mastering the printed literature around the events of a creation of a work of art. ""The method adopted by Hess consisted of taking into account every conceivable historical circumstance, great or small, and assimilating all that could be discovered about a work of art and the literature that surrounded it.""

1008,"Hoffmann, Edith",24-Jul-07,"Vienna, Austria",,,"Private scholar; editorial Secretary and Assistant Editor of the <u>The Burlington Magazine</u>, 1938-1950. Hoffmann was the daughter of the writer and Czech diplomat Camill Hoffmann and his wife, Irma Oplatka. Her father was a friend of the Austrian Expressionist artist Oskar Kokoschka. After attending elementary school in the suburban town of Hellerau bei Dresden, she graduated from the Auguste Victoria Girls' School in Berlin in 1928. She continued studies in archaeology and art history at the universities in Berlin (under <a href=""/goldschmidta"">Adolph Goldschmidt</a>), Vienna (under <a href=""/schlosserj"">Julius Schlosser</a>) and Munich, under <a href=""/pinderw"">Wilhelm Pinder</a>. She received her doctorate in 1934 under Pinder writing a thesis on eighteenth-century German group portraits. With the rise of the Nazis in 1933, Hoffmann, a Jew, fled to Britain, volunteering initially in the Print Room of the British Museum. She joined <u>The Burlington Magazine</u> in 1939 under editor <a href=""/readh"">Herbert Read</a> as editorial secretary. Four weeks before the outbreak of war, art historians from many countries had gathered in London to attend the International Congress of the History of Art, among them many Germans. Read used the opportunity in an editorial welcome to the Congress in <u>The Burlington Magazine</u> to emphasize the magazine's editorial policy of equality, implicitly contrasting it with the persecution in Germany. After war broke out, Hoffmann formed part of a group of refugees invited to contribute to the magazine under Read's editorship and later under <a href=""/boreniust"">Tancred Borenius</a>. In addition to British writers--young researchers such as <a href=""/popehennessyj"">John Pope-Hennessy</a> or senior researchers such as <a href=""/binyonl"">Laurence Binyon</a> and <a href=""/dodgsonc"">Campbell Dodgson</a>--expatriate art historians such as <a href=""/gombriche"">Ernst Gombrich</a>, <a href=""/kurzo"">Otto Kurz</a>, <a href=""/puyveldel"">Leo van Puyvelde</a> and <a href=""/pevsnern"">Nikolaus Pevsner</a> also contributed. Hoffmann ran the magazine during the hardships of restrictions: paper scarcity, fewer advertisers, and fewer foreign subscribers. Although in an unofficial capacity, Hoffmann became in effect the first woman to be in charge of the magazine (Pezzini). She married Eliezer Yapou in 1940, a journalist (later doctor of law) raised in the (today) Palestine region. After Borenius left in 1944, <a href=""/waterhousee"">Ellis Waterhouse</a> acted as editorial consultant and Hoffmann continued as Assistant Editor. Hoffmann was in charge of the total production of the magazine while Waterhouse's contribution was limited to an advisory role of selecting articles--usually, according to Hoffmann, in short order. She was promoted to Assistant Editor in 1946. Hoffmann published the first monograph on Kokoschka in English in 1947, including essays by the artist himself. The same year <a href=""/nicolsonb"">Benedict Nicolson</a> was appointed editor of the magazine. Hoffmann left the magazine in 1950 to accompany her husband, an Israeli diplomat, to various international postings, including Tel-Aviv, Brussels, New York and Jerusalem. She contributed to the <u>Encyclopedia Hebraica</u> beginning in1953 (to 1965). In New York, she supplied monthly reviews and surveys of exhibitions for the <u>Burlington Magazine</u>, 1957-1958. She lectured in art history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1960-1961. She again wrote art reviews for the magazine while in Paris, 1974-1975. In the 1990s she retired in Jerusalem.  Hoffmann's main research interest was modern art, principally German Expressionism and, in later years, Symbolism and its literary connections. She wrote over 150 articles, exhibition and book reviews in her lifetime. She is not to be confused with Edith Hoffmann (1888-1945) who worked at the Printroom of the Budapest SzĚ©pm�±vĚ©szeti MĚĽzeum and publisher of works on DĚ_rer and Hungarian art.BP/LS",Czechoslovakia;Germany;UK;Israel,"Hoffmann, Edith.

Homburger attended the local Gymnasium in Karlsruhe, graduating and spending a year in volunteer military service in 1903.

Homburger continued to assist Goldschmidt with his corpus of ivory carving, <u>Die Elfenbeinskulpturen</u>, which was concluded in 1918. He worked as a curator and later acting director of the Baden state museum in Karlsruhe, Germany, between 1919-1927. His 1928 <u>Art Bulletin</u> review of <u>English Illuminated Manuscripts</u> by Eric Millar (q.v.) was a significant supplement to this area. Between 1930 and 1935 he served as honorary professor at the university in Marburg. In 1935 he was declared ""non-Aryan"" by the Nazi government, for, although protestant, he was of Jewish extraction. He left Germany for Switzerland in 1936.

Horn was the son of a Karl Horn, a Lutheran minister, and Matilde Peters (Horn). He grew up in Heidelberg, attending the university there, and in Berlin and Hamburg studying art history. He settled on the newly establish art history department there, writing his disseration under <a href=""/panofskye"">Erwin Panofsky</a>. Horn served as a research associate beginning in 1934 at the Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florence. His disseration was on the fascade of the church of St-Gilles, was granted for his Ph.D.from Hamburg in 1937. Horn's first article, ""Das Florentiner Bapisterium,"" 1938, disproved a Roman or early Christian date for the famous baptistry, based on a careful study of the building materials. Horn's strong opposition to National Socialism forced him to emigrate to the United States the same year. He secured an appointment at the University of California, Berkeley as a visiting lecturer in 1939 and assistant professor the following year. He remained there his entire career.He married Ann Binkley Rand. Horn became a U.S. citizen in 1943 and joined the army to fight the Nazis. He became part of General George S. Patton's 3rd Army in Europe. Given his art background, he was transferred to the division to investigate looted treasures in Germany, Third Army Intelligence Center, interviewing Germans responsible for the thefts. He was discharged from the army with the rank of captain in 1946 and returned to Berkeley and was appointed professor in 1948. In 1949. He married a second time to Alberta West Parker, a physician. Together with the classicist <a href=""/amyxd"">Darrell A. Amyx</a>, he helped found the History of Art Department at Berkeley. After participating in a conference on the plan of St. Gall in 1957, he published a 1958 article on the bay system in stone architecture. Horn concluded that stone structures of the Romanesque period owed much to the wood churches of the era which had all disappeared. Horn employed a San Francisco architect and draftsman, <a href=""/borne"">Ernst Born</a>, to assist him with his drawings. Beginning in 1960, Born and Horn began collaborating on the measurement of medieval buildings, publishing several studies of related Cistercian buildings in England and France. Born went on to a career in architectural history at Berkeley through Horn's encouragement. Horn retired emeritus from the University in 1974. In 1979, Horn and Born published a complete study of the plan of St. Gall which received twelve major awards and the AIA medal. His students include <a href=""/kleinbauerw"">W. Eugene Kleinbauer</a> (master's degree). The hallmark of Horn's methodology was the precise date of medieval buildings by a study of their building techniques and materials. Throughout his career, Horn contended that the plan of St. Gall was a copy of a lost master plan of 816 or 817. This proved controversial and many of Horn's greatest critics argued that the plan was an ideal plan rather than actual.",Germany;USA,"Kleinbauer, W.

Huth studied art history, archaeology, and philosophy at the Universities at Halle under Wilhelm Waetzoldt (q.v.) and Vienna under Max Dvo�ŞĚÁk (q.v.), and Julius Schlosser (q.v.). His studies were interrupted by service in World War I as an artillery officer (Lieutenant); both of his older brothers were killed in war action. In 1918 he returned to the University in Berlin, completing his graduate degree in art history under Adolph Goldschmidt (q.v.).

After working as a volunteer at the Bavarian National Museum, he joined the staff of the Royal Palace and Gardens of the Prussian Museums consortium in Berlin in 1925. He married Marta Baumann (b. 1896), an artist and photographer the following year. Huth worked on museum inventories and the gardens as his principal curatorial duties. He added the duties of private librarian for the Hohenzollern family in 1933. Huth's Jewish parentage (he himself was a declared protestant) forced him out of Nazi Germany in 1937. He first went to France, again acting as librarian for the private collection of the philanthropist James Hazen Hyde (1876-1959) in Versailles.

In 1935, at the suggestion of Panofsky, who had fled Germany in 1933 for the United States, <a href=""/barra"">Alfred Barr</a>, director of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, sponsored Janson as an immigrant to the United States where he had been awarded a Charles Holtzer fellowship at Harvard University. Janson studied at Harvard between 1935-1942 under <a href=""/postc"">Chandler R. Post</a> and <a href=""/sachsp"">Paul J. Sachs</a>. He became close and lifelong friends with fellow Harvard art-history student <a href=""/freedbergs"">Syndey J. Freedberg</a>. Janson worked at the Worcester Museum of Art, Worcester, MA, 1938, while pursuing his graduate degree and then at the University of Iowa, 1938-1941. According to his son, Anthony, Janson drew the ire of the chairman of the Iowa department of art, the painter Grant Wood, for taking art students to see a Picasso show in Chicago. In 1941 he left Iowa for Washington University in St. Louis, MO, and an assistant professorship, marrying <a href=""/jansond"">Dora Heineberg</a>, an art-history undergraduate at Radcliffe, the same year. His Ph.D. was awarded from Harvard in 1942 on the subject of Michelozzo. His family remained in Germany during World War II, where his brother, fighting for the Nazis, was killed in 1943. During World War II, when many universities had been converted to soldier training camps, Janson lectured on physics and Russian to American soldiers in St. Louis. He became a citizen in 1943. In 1946 he was appointed associate professor of art history.Janson left Missouri for New York in 1949 where he was appointed professor and chairman of the department of art at New York University. He remained chair for twenty-five years, developing the undergraduate (Washington Square) program into one of the finest in the nation. He was adjunct faculty at the Institute of Fine Arts, the graduate program at NYU, though frictions developed between the graduate faculty and Janson. He was awarded a Guggenheim fellowship for 1952-1953. That same year he published <u>Apes and Ape Lore in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance</u>, for which he was a recipient of the Charles Rufus Morey Prize from the College Art Association. In 1957, using the initial work of the late <a href=""/lanyij"">JenĚ¦ LĚÁnyi</a>, Janson published a book on Donatello, <u>The Sculpture of Donatello</u>, which was again awarded a Morey Prize from the College Art Association. In 1959. Janson issued a book of plates of the monuments of art history, titled <u>Key Monuments of the History of Art</u>, to aid his undergraduates in their student of art since the availability of good personal study images was not then available. He followed this in a work co-written with his wife, Dora, with a survey of Western art, their <u>History of Art</u>. It grew over the years to be the best-selling textbook of any subject in the United States and, known simply as ""Janson,"" was for years was the standard text. Janson's interests turned to nineteenth-century art in later years. In 1974 Janson delivered the Mellon lectures at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC on 19th-century sculpture. Together with Peter Fusco (b. 1945), he organized a show of that era sculpture for the Los Angeles County Museum of art in 1980. Janson was awarded an honorary doctorate from the Institute of Fine Arts in 1981. He was working on revisions of his Mellon lecture for a book at the time of his death on a train between Italy and Switzerland. Because Janson's appointment at NYU was primarily at the undergraduate level, he had few Ph.D. students compared to others of his profile at the University. His students (at Washington University) included <a href=""/lavini"">Irving Lavin</a> and <a href=""/lavinm"">Marilyn Aronberg Lavin</a>. Janson's work, especially his Ape lore book, show the influence of the Hamburg school/Warburg influence. The book focuses on the history of art or styles as much as it does mythological phenomenon and its manifestation in material culture. Janson 1962 <u>History of Art</u> was an instant best seller, contrasting it from the other predominant art-history text, <u>Art Through the  Ages</u> by <a href=""/gardnerh"">Helen Gardner</a>, which by its numerous posthumous revisions treated art as a history of styles. Janson's book came under criticism in later years for its lack of women artists.  Subsequent editions written by his son, Anthony F. Janson (b. 1943), altered this.",Germany;USA,"Kleinbauer, W.

1128,"Katzenellenbogen, Adolf",1901,"Frankfurt am Main, Germany",1964,"Baltimore, MD, USA","Medievalist, wrote important monograph on sculpture at Chartres. Katzenellenbogen (literally, ""cat's elbow"" in German) was the son of the jurist and bank director Albert Katzenellenbogen (1863-1942) and Cornelia Josephine Doctor (1870-1941), both assimilated Jews. His parents, intent on him pursuing a business career, sent him to England to learn the language at an early age. In Frankfurt, he received his <i>Abitur</i> from the Goethe-Gymnasium in 1920. Katzenellenbogen studied Law at Giessen, 1920-1923, receiving his doctor of jurisprudence in 1924. Beginning in 1926, he pursued art history at the newly-established University in Hamburg under the outstanding ""Hamburg school"" art historians <a href=""/panofskye"">Erwin Panofsky</a>, <a href=""/saxlf"">Fritz Saxl</a> and to a lesser extent, <a href=""/tolnayc"">Charles de Tolnay</a>. His dissertation, written under Panofsky, was on medieval iconography. His Ph.D. was granted in 1933. He moved to Konstanz (Constance), Germany, the same year as a private teacher associate with the university, supported by his family. He married the Swiss native Elisabeth Martha Holzheu (1904-1983), in 1935, a pianist. During these years, Katzenellenbogen researched the influence of theology on medieval iconography, findings which would later become his book on medieval allegories. His liberal political affiliations and his ""non-Aryan"" status resulted in his 1938 interning at the Dachau concentration camp. His health seriously declined there. Through the intervention of the Swiss art collector Oskar Reinhart (1885-1965) in Winterthur, he was freed and brought to Switzerland. After convalescence, Katzenellenbogen emigrated to England in 1939. There he published the first of two important monographs on medieval iconography, <u>Allegories of the Virtues and Vices in Medieval Art</u>, under the auspices of the Warburg Institute. He next emigrated to the United States late the same year. Through the assistance of his dissertation advisor, Panofsky, already a professor in the U.S., and New York University professor <a href=""/cookw"">Walter W. S. Cook</a>, he secured academic positions, beginning with Vassar College as a visiting lecturer in 1940. While in the U.S. he learned his father had perished in the extermination camp at Auschwitz in 1942. In 1943 he was appointed assistant professor at Vassar. Katzenellenbogen published a groundbreaking article on the influence of the Crusades in medieval iconography, ""The Central Tympanum at VĚ©zelay: Its Encyclopedic Meaning and Its Relation to the First Crusade,"" in 1944. He became an American Citizen in 1946 and was promoted to associate professor in 1947. Katzenellenbogen was made (full) professor in 1953. With Panofsky he was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, NJ. After a visiting professorship at Smith, 1956-1958, he accepted the position as professor of Johns Hopkins University in 1958. The following year he published his important <u>Sculptural Programs of Chartres Cathedral</u>, which won the College Art Association's Charles Rufus Morey award. He was a visiting professor at University of Freiberg in 1963. He died at age 63 after returning from an art conference in Germany. His M.A. students at Hopkins included the Dutch scholar <a href=""/schwartzg"">Gary Schwartz</a>. Katzenellenbogen was first an iconographer, trained by Panofsky and influenced by the French iconographer <a href=""/malee"">Ěämile MĚ˘le</a>.

1132,"Kaufmann, Emil",1891,"Vienna, Austria",1953,"Cheyenne, WY, USA","Ledoux and French Revolutionary architecture scholar. Kaufmann was the son of Max Kaufmann (d. 1902), businessman, and Friederike Baumwald (Kaufmann) (b. 1862). He was raised in Vienna, attending the Maximiliansgymnasium, 9th region of the city (IX Bezirk) along with the future Warburg School art historian <a href=""/saxlf"">Fritz Saxl</a>. He received his <em>Abitur</em> in 1909 and entered the Exportakademie (literally, Export Academy), studying trade through 1911. Beginning in 1913 he attended lectures in the humanities at the Universities of Innsbruck and Vienna. At Innsbruck he studied art history under <a href=""/hammerh"">Heinrich Hammer</a>, at Vienna archaeology with <a href=""/lowye"">Emanuel LĚ¦wy</a>, general history under Ludwig Pastor (1854-1928), and art history under <a href=""/semperh"">Hans Semper</a> and the Vienna School masters <a href=""/dvorakm"">Max Dvo�ŞĚÁk</a> and his students <a href=""/schlosserj"">Julius von Schlosser</a> and <a href=""/tietzeh"">Hans Tietze</a>. He also attended the competing school of art history at the University of Vienna run by <a href=""/strzygowski"">Josef Strzygowski</a> and <a href=""/dregerm"">Moriz Dreger</a>. Kaufmann fought as a soldier in World War I and attending school intermittently because of illness. He received his Ph.D. in 1920, writing his dissertation under Dvo�ŞĚÁk on the development of the architecture of Ledoux and classicism. After graduation Kaufmann could find no work as an art historian. He earned a living as a bank employee in Vienna, continuing his art-history research on the side. In 1933, Kaufmann published a monograph on Ledoux (the first full-length one) <u>Von Ledoux bis Le Courbusier</u>. The work was in fact a polemic on the development of modern architecture from 1770 to 1920. This sweeping thesis found many opponents. Most famously <a href=""/schapierom"">Meyer Schapiro</a>, who found it simplistic, and the conservative Vienna-School <a href=""/sedlmayrh"">Hans Sedlmayr</a> (Schapiro's nemesis) who found it a symptom of the pathology of modernism (<u>Verlust der Mitte</u>). He published numerous articles and dictionary entries (the Thieme-Becker lexikon ones on Ledoux and Marmorek). He lectured at the Urania museum, the Museum fĚ_r Kunst und Gewerbe and Austrian radio. Significant articles on Ledoux and the architect BoullĚ©e (the latter in English) were also published. With the annexation of Austria by the Nazi's, Kaufmann, a Jew, emigrated to the United States. With little means of support, he lived penuriously, continuing to research French architecture, ""the only reward was his satisfaction in revealing hidden aspects in the history of architecture and in scholarly work well done"" (Schapiro). He was a Fellow at the Research School of the University of Southern California in 1941. He moved to the eastern United States were he lectured at Princeton, Harvard, Yale and the University of Chicago. While lecturing, Kaufmann worked on his book on revolutionary architecture. Kaufmann received grants from the American Philosophical Society and a Fulbright. He died in Wyoming while traveling to Los Angeles before his magnum opus could be completed. It was published posthumously in 1955. Some of his papers are at the American Philosophical Society, Philadelphia. Kaufmann brought the theories and work of the innovative architects prior to and of the French Revolution to modern scholarship. Using largely formal analysis and theoretical writings to exact social-historical significance, he created what <a href=""/bazing"">Germain Bazin</a> termed the ""hĚ©tĚ©ronome"" Baroque. Like his contemporary <a href=""/francastelp"">Pierre Francastel</a>, Kaufmann has been accused of writing Franco-centric architectural histories (Bois). <a href=""/panofskye"">Erwin Panofsky</a> wrote at the time of his immigration the the U.S. that he was the only person in his field of neo-classical architectural theory. Kaufmann's use of the Kantian notions of autonomy and modernism influenced the work of later critics, historians and architects such as <a href=""/johnsonp"">Philip Johnson</a> in the 1940s, <a href=""/rowec"">Colin Rowe</a> in the 1950s and Aldo Rossi (1931-1997) in the 1950s and 1960s (Vidler, 2002).",Austria;USA,"""Biographical Note."" <u>American Society of Architectural Historians Journal</u> 3 no. 3 (July 1943): 12; Teyssot, Georges.

1157,"Kitzinger, Ernst",1912,"Munich, Germany",2003,"Poughkeepsie, NY","Influential Harvard Byzantinist and medievalist art historian. Kitzinger's father, Wilhelm Nathan Kitzinger (1870-1945) was a Munich lawyer and his mother Elisabeth Rahel Merzbacher (1881-1966), a woman devoted to social causes connected with Judaism. Kitzinger's cousin, Richard Krautheimer (q.v.) would also become a distinguished medievalist in Europe and the United States. Kitzinger attended the Max-Gymnasium in Munich, graduating in 1931. Between 1931-34 he studied art history, archaeology, and philosophy at the universities in Munich where his professors included Ernst Buschor (q.v.) and Wilhelm Pinder (q.v.). Pinder's ideological thrust emphasized the ""Germanness"" of medieval art, a characteristic Kitzinger never adopted. His dissertation, written under Pinder, was on the topic of Roman painting between the 7th and 8th centuries A.D. The tiny forty-plus page thesis, completed when Kitzinger was only 21, persuasively argued against the prevailing notion of a hegemonic ""Alexandrian"" style in favor of eastern Mediterranean influences. Kitzinger left Germany in 1935 when it became ever clearer that academic careers would be barred to Jews by the Nazis. He first went to Rome, where did post-doctorate studies with Pietro Toesca (q.v.), and then to England where accepted a position at the British Museum under the brilliant Keeper, T. D. Kendrick (q.v.). Kitzinger's research on Anglo-Saxon arts of northern England and southern Scotland in the Department of British and Mediaeval Antiquities resulted in one of his most enduring books, the 1940 <u>Early Medieval Art at the British Museum</u>. It is still a standard introduction to medieval art. While at the museum, the great 7th-century ship burial at Sutton Hoo was excavated in 1939 and Kitzinger was responsible for the first assessment of this extraordinary late-Roman and early Byzantine silver plate discovery. When England entered the war against Germany, Kitzinger was interned as an enemy alien and evacuated to Australia. After his release in 1941, he emigrated to the United States where he was appointed a junior fellow at the newly founded Center for Byzantine Studies, Dumbarton Oaks, Harvard's medieval research center in Washington, DC, whose director was the great Carolingian manuscript scholar Wilhelm Koehler (q.v.). His security clearance reinstated, Kitzinger served as a research analyst for the Office of Strategic Services in Washington and London between 1943 and 1945. He married [Margaret] Susan Theobald Ranby (1915-2000), a devoted Quaker and painter in 1944. Kitzinger returned to Harvard and Dumbarton Oaks in 1946 where he was named assistant professor of Byzantine art and archaeology. As a 1950-51 Fulbright Scholar, he was engaged in research on the Byzantine mosaics of the Norman kingdom of Sicily, a topic concomitantly investigated by fellow Byzantinist Otto Demus (q.v.). Kitzinger's review of Demus's <u>The Mosaics of Norman Sicily</u> (1950) was itself a work of scholarship and fairness on the topic. His own monograph on the topic, <u>The Mosaics of Monreale</u> appeared in 1960. He was appointed associate professor at Harvard in 1951. As a Guggenheim Fellow, 1953-54, he continued his field research, traveling to Italy, Greece, Yugoslavia and Turkey. Between 1955 and 1966 Kitzinger was Director of Byzantine Studies at Dumbarton Oaks, transforming that institution into the world's premiere Byzantine studies center. He was appointed full professor at Harvard in 1956. In 1966, he accepted an appointment at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, NJ. Wishing to devote more time to teaching, he returned to Harvard in 1967, this time the campus in Cambridge, MA, as the first A. Kingsley Porter University Professor. A series of lectures Kitzinger gave as Slade Professor at Cambridge University between 1974 and 1975 resulted in the 1977 book, <u>Byzantine Art in the Making</u>. His collected articles appeared in 1976 as <u>The Art of Byzantium and the Medieval West: Selected Studies</u>. In 1979 he retired from Harvard and moved to Oxford, a city he had developed an affinity for during his first stay in England. In the 1980s, Kitzinger researched and wrote a six-volume survey of the Norman mosaics of Sicily. Surprising to many, however, Oxford failed to make use of Kitzinger's presence and expertise. During his final years, he divided his retirement time between Princeton and Oxford. Kitzinger's many distinguished students included Irving Lavin (q.v.).  Kitzinger was among the generation of German art historians who fled Nazi persecution and brought to the United States a methodologically rigorous and intellectually ambitious brand of art scholarship. The virtue of Kitzinger's work was its ability ""to connect what was happening visually to what was happening conceptually; the history of art [of Kitzinger] became a history of ideas"" (Lavin). Kitzinger rejected the conventional term ""Early Christian"" for the area of his research, insisting that it failed to encompass monuments as different as the Hagia Sophia or the encaustic icons preserved at St. Catherine's monastery of Mount Sinai. He also pioneered the concept of ""modes"" of artistic representation. These modes or distinct styles linked to specific subject matter were first used by Kitzinger to characterize the differing appearances of angels at Santa Maria Antiqua, Rome. Likewise, the 1958 paper ""Byzantine Art in the Period Between Justinian and Iconoclasm,"" presented in Munich, remains the most perceptive construct of the arts of the Mediterranean before the destruction of images. Kitzinger's reliance on style as an element of analysis had detractors. Some voiced concern that his reliance on formal structure was employed even when the object's provenance and date were under question. Among medievalists, it has been noted that he practiced his craft in research institutions more than in the field. Kitzinger was a skilled promoter of budding art historical talent without imposing a particular school of thought.",Germany;USA,"Kleinbauer, W.

1177,"Koehler, Wilhelm Reinhold Walter",1884,"Reval, Russian Empire; [present day Tallin, Estonia]",1959,"Munich, Germany","Medievalist and museum director, professor of art at Harvard. KĚ¦hler attended a Gymnasium in WolfenbĚ_ttel. Between the years 1903-1907 he studied art history in Strassburg, Bonn, and finally Vienna. His dissertation in 1906 was written under the so-called ""first"" Vienna-school art historians <a href=""/wickhofff"">Franz Wickhoff</a> and advisor <a href=""/dvorakm"">Max Dvo�ŞĚÁk</a>. The following year he began a project of publishing illuminated manuscripts organized by school, Die karolingischen Miniaturen, for the Deutsche Verein fĚ_r Kunstwissenschaft. The scope of the task was such that the first volumes appeared only in 1930-1933 and the second volume twenty-five years later. Between 1906-1909 he was an assistant for Wickhoff at the University. He served in the military in World War I in Poland and later researching in Belgium. After the war (1918) he was offered a position as director of the new art collection in Weimar (Staatlichen Kunstammlungen). He developed contacts with many Bauhaus faculty including Paul Klee and Lyonel Feininger. He married Bauhaus school student Margarete Bittkow (d. 1964) in 1920. The product of his war years research on Carolingian art appeared in 1923 as Belgische KunstdenkmĚ_ler, edited by Paul Clemen. From 1924 he also held a professorship at Jena University. The first volumes of his Carolingian manuscript study, Die Schule von Tours (School of Tours), appeared between 1930-1933. His association with modern art brought him into increasing conflict with the national socialist government. KĚ¦hler came to Harvard in 1932 as the Kuno Franke Visiting Professor of German Art and Culture. When Harvard's well-known medievalist A. Kingsley Porter died in a drowning accident the following year, KĚ¦hler was asked to replace him. He hereafter anglicized the spelling of his name. In 1941-1943 he served as Senior Fellow in charge of Studies at Dumbarton Oaks, contributing his imporatant essay ""Byzantine Art in the West."" Koehler was named William Dorr Boardman professor in 1950. He retired emeritus in 1953. In his retirement he brought out volume two of his manuscript series, begun in the 1920s and still published in German by the Deutsche Verein, Die Hofschule Karls des Grossen, in 1958. A third volume, Die Gruppe des Wiener KrĚ¦nungs-Evangeliars and Metzer Handschriften, completed before his death, was published shortly thereafter. Subsequent volumes have been published in a slightly different form, edited by Florentine MĚ_therich of the Zentralinstitut fĚ_r Kunstgeschichte, completed on this basis of his notes. Koehler's students included Whitney Stoddard. Koehler's scholarship focused on Carolingian manuscript illumination. He also taught and published on the northern baroque and modern period of art history. Although he worked steadily to complete a survey of illuminated manuscripts (commissioned by the Bollingen Foundation), this was never finished. His methodology employs the Geistesgeschichte-style of art history of his mentor, Dvo�ŞĚÁk. His ""Byzantine Art in the West"" essay extended the psychological analysis approach of the work of Wilhelm VĚ¦ge on Chartres (Panofsky). In his manuscript treatises, he grouped schools together by handwriting as well as by stylistic similarities. As the professor at the Fogg, then Harvard student Jules Prown described him as a professor who taught students how to look at an object: ""he would often give a two-hour seminar using one slide."" Student Otto Wittmann characterized him as a spellbinding lecturer. MĚ_therich described Koehler's contribution to the Carolingian Miniatures as the masterpiece that made Koehler's reputation. Subsequent volumes (by other scholars) focused more on sources whereas Koehler's School of Tours was written for further research into manuscripts.",Germany;USA,"Panofsky, Erwin.

At 22, she married the promising art historian Richard Krautheimer (q.v.). She studied art history at the universities in Jena, Frankfurt and Berlin, graduating in 1928 under the supervision of Adolf Goldschmidt (q.v.) and Rudolf Kautzsch (q.v.). Her dissertation, <u>Die figurale Plastik der Ostlombardei von 1100 bis 1178</u>, was published in the <u>Marburger Jahrbuch fĚ_r Kunstwissenschaft</u> the same year. She assisted her husband in research in Rome and elsewhere until the two were forced to emigrate because of religious persecution of Jews. In 1935 they moved to the United States where Richard taught art history first in Louisville, Kentucky and then at Vassar. In 1942 she volunteered for war service in the American Red Cross. For most of the 1950s she was actively involved researching Lorenzo Ghiberti, which resulted in the book of the same title, co-authored with her husband published in 1956. Throughout the 1940's and 50's she published articles in the <u>Art Bulletin</u> and <u>Burlington Magazine</u>. By the 1960's, Krautheimer had amassed a personal collection of Italian master drawings and was known in New York art circles as a connoisseur of distinction.

1198,"Krautheimer, Richard",06 July 1897,"FĚ_rth, Franconia, Germany",1-Nov-94,"Rome, Italy","Byzantinist and baroque scholar, architectural historian; Director of Institute of Fine Art, New York University. Krautheimer was the son of Nathan Krautheimer (1854-1910) and Martha Landman (Krautheimer) (1875-1967). His cousin was <a href=""/kitzingere"">Ernst Kitzinger</a> who also became an eminent medievalist art historian. As a young man, Krautheimer enlisted in the (German) army in the First World War and saw serious war service (1916-1918). Between 1919-1923 he studied initially at the university in Jura and then successively at the universities in Munich, Berlin, and Marburg under faculty who included <a href=""/wolfflinh"">Heinrich WĚ¦lfflin</a>, <a href=""/goldschmidta"">Adolph Goldschmidt</a> and <a href=""/weisbachw"">Werner Weisbach</a>. He briefly worked on the state inventory of Churches for Erfurt (Inventarisierung der Erfurter Kirchen fĚ_r die Preussische Denkmalpflege) during this time as well. In 1924 he married <a href=""/krautheimerhesst"">Trude Hess</a> who subsequently also studied art history and became a noted scholar and collector herself. His dissertation was completed in Halle under <a href=""/franklp"">Paul Frankl</a> in 1925 with the title <u>Die Kirchen der Bettelorden in Deutschland (1240-1340)</u>. Frankl remained a strong influence to Krautheimer's work throughout his life. It was Krautheimer who later introduced Frankl's work to a United States readership (SauerlĚ_nder). In 1927 he completed his habilitation under <a href=""/hamannr"">Richard Hamann</a> in Marburg-Wittenberg. The same year, while researching at the Bibliotheca Hertziana in Rome, Krautheimer developed the idea for a handbook of Roman churches with a colleague, <a href=""/wittkowerr"">Rudolf Wittkower</a>. This later to became the <u>Corpus Basilicarum</u>. In 1928 he accepted a <i>privatdozent</i> teaching position at Marburg. Except for studies-in-residence at the Hertziana (1930/31, 1932/33) he remained at Marburg. The momentous year 1933 saw Krautheimer's first volume of the <u>Corpus Basilicarum Christianarum Romae</u>, a scholarly inventory and documentation of the early Christian churches in Rome eventually running five volumes. The set, however, would not be completed until 1977. That same year, 1933, the Krautheimers fled Nazi persecution, leaving Germany for good. Between 1933-1935 Krautheimer worked on the <u>Corpus</u> in Rome, working a day job that had been offered by Frankl's son in that city. The ever-declining political situation for Jews in Axis-alliance countries compelled the Krautheimers to emigrate to the United States. Krautheimer initially found a position at the University of Louisville, Kentucky, a university he purportedly had never heard of. At his request, Louisville hired another fleeing art historian, Krautheimer's friend from school days, <a href=""/bierj"">Justus Bier</a>. Krautheimer moved to Vassar College in 1937 at the request of Vassar's Art Department chair, <a href=""/claflina"">Agnes Claflin</a>. With the United State's entrance into the Second World War, Krautheimer and his wife became naturalized citizens and Richard volunteered for duty as a senior research analyst for the Office of Strategic Services for the years 1942-1944. Here he analyzed aerial photographs of Rome to assist in the protection of historic buildings during bombing. While still at Vassar, he taught (with lecturer status) at New York University (1938-1949). In 1942, Krautheimer published an influential article, ""The Carolingian Revival of Early Christian Architecture,"" in the <u>Art Bulletin</u> postulating a conceptual frame for medieval architecture as an intellectual ""copy"" or pastiche of venerable structures. He moved to NYU permanently in 1952 as the Jayne Wrightsman Professor of Fine Arts. The early 1950s were devoted to researching his one monograph on an artist, Lorenzo Ghiberti, published jointly with his wife in 1956. Krautheimer next engaged in what he considered his most difficult book to research and write: the survey volume on early Christian architecture for the <u>Pelican History of Art</u> series. The manuscript was completed in 1963 and published two years later. The volume is considered to be one of the finest syntheses of late antique/early medieval architecture ever published and brought Krautheimer his widest readership. He revised and reissued the work twice, in 1975 and 1979. After a second book on Ghiberti in 1971, Krautheimer retired from NYU as Samuel F. B. Morse Professor Emeritus and returned to Rome. <a href=""/lotzw"">Wolfgang Lotz</a>, friend and fellow architectural historian, offered him a residence at the Bibliotheca Hertziana. There, Krautheimer completed his long-standing research on the <u>Corpus Basilicarum</u>. In these final years he set to work writing two of his most synthetic and lyrical works on art history. <u>Rome: Profile of a City</u> (1980) and <u>The Rome of Alexander VII</u> (1985) combined social history, vast breadth of archival knowledge and insightful architectural history into single volumes. In both cases, Krautheimer selected comparatively neglected periods in Roman history to offer a compelling narrative of the interaction of public works and patronage. While assisting friends with plans for his 100<sup>th</sup> birthday, Krauthiemer died at 97 at the Palazzo Zuccari. He is buried in the Protestant Cemetery in Rome with his wife. In terms of art-historical approach, the systematizing methodology of Krautheimer's mentor, Frankl, ""never left Krautheimer"" according to <a href=""/sauerlanderw"">Willibald Sauerlander</a>. In his teaching, he preferred Frankl's older German survey of the Romanesque to the <u>Pelican History of Art</u> survey by<a href=""/conantk""> Kenneth Conant</a>, which he disparaged (Sears). As a medievalist, he emphasized German and eastern-European works, presenting a different Middle Ages from that of the predominantly Francophone American-teaching-medievalists, <a href=""/portera"">A. Kingsley Porter</a> and <a href=""/focillonh"">Henri Focillon</a> (Sears). Krautheimer's conception of the medieval found new adherents after World War II among Marxist and Marxist-influenced historians, particularly in Germany. The modernist view of medieval architecture, one centered around the study of St-Denis and an intellectual overlay of the theories of Pseudo-Dionysius (<a href=""/sedlmayrh"">Hans Sedlmayr</a>, <a href=""/panofskye"">Erwin Panofsky</a>, <a href=""/simsono"">Otto von Simson</a>), had been countered by Krautheimer's 1942 article on the church as 'copy.' In it, he argued that medieval architects built churches as 'copies' of venerable archetypal structures. ""By linking symbolism with the perceptions of the medieval onlooker, Krautheimer found a way of understanding the loose associations between form and meaning in the Middle Ages, and relating meaning to tradition and patrimonial intention"" (Crossley). Hans-Joachim Kunst, in particular adapted this notion to a Marxist social history as the ""archictectural quotation."" Krautheimer's many students at New York University included <a href=""/saalmanh"">Howard Saalman</a>, <a href=""/steinbergl"">Leo Steinberg</a>, <a href=""/huemerf"">Frances Huemer</a>, <a href=""/trachtenbergm"">Marvin Trachtenberg</a>, <a href=""/mathewst"">Thomas Mathews</a>, Meg (Meinecke) Licht (b. 1926), and <a href=""/ackermanj"">James Ackerman</a>.",Germany;USA,"Kleinbauer, W.

1201,"Kris, Ernst",1900,"Vienna, Austria",1957,"New York, NY, USA","Second-Vienna-School authority on Renaissance gold work and engraved gems; a psychoanalyst who employed psychoanalytical approach to art history. Kris was the son of Leopold Kris, a lawyer, and Rosa Schick (Kris). Because a War coal shortage forced his Gymnasium (district 13) to reduce school hours, Kris heard his first college-level art history courses during mornings. After graduating in 1918, he entered the University of Vienna studying art history, archaeology and psychology. After an initial examination under <a href=""/dvorakm"">Max Dvo�ŞĚÁk</a> in 1919, he studied with <a href=""/schlosserj"">Julius von Schlosser</a>. Both Dvo�ŞĚÁk and Schlosser were key historians of the so-called second Vienna school of art history. Kris was a spectacular student under Schlosser, whom Kris recalled Schlosser as saying he was <i>mein UrschĚ_ler</i> (student most akin to him). In 1922, Kris wrote his dissertation under Schlosser, examining the interrelationship between renaissance art and science within two renaissance craftsmen, Bernhard Palissy (1510-1590) and Wenzel Jamnitzer (1507-1785). He joined the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna the same year as an unpaid assistant. In 1927 Kris was appointed a curator of sculpture and applied arts and married Marianne Rie, a physician and psychoanalyst, the daughter of Sigmund Freud's physician, Oskar Rie (1863-1931). As a result, Kris became fascinated by psychological approaches to art. In 1928 he published his <u>Meister und Meisterwerke der Steinschneidekunst in der italienischen Renaissance</u> a major contribution to the history of engraved gems. During this time he met another important Schlosser student, <a href=""/gombriche"">Ernst Gombrich</a>. Kris' scholarship and close friendship with the director of sculpture, <a href=""/planiscigl"">Leo Planiscig</a> made him an international authority in renaissance metal arts. He and Paniscig rehung the Hapsburg collection of the Kunsthistorisches according to chronology and patronage, rather than my medium as it had been. Kris delivered two papers on the busts of sculptor Franz-Xavier Messerschmidt using psychoanalytic approaches, one for art historians and another for psychoanalysts. While still working on the catalog of the goldwork for the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Kris became an editor of <u>Imago: Zeitschrift fĚ_r Psychoanalytische Psychologie</u>, a journal of applied psychoanalysis in 1933. He also began studying medicine and practiced psychoanalysis on his own. Kris reconnected with Gombrich, jointly researching caricature and facial expression in art (published in a abbreviated form in 1940). Kris also initiated a research project on the myth of the artist with <a href=""/kurzo"">Otto Kurz</a>. As the alliance between Hitler's Germany and Austria grew ever stronger, it was Kris who recommended Gombrich for a position at the Warburg Library, now in a temporary home in London, which Kurz would also later flee. Kris emigrated to England in 1938 as a psychoanalyst and later working for the British government as a translator of German radio broadcasts (as Gombrich did, too.) By 1940 Kris had secured a position at the New School for Social Research in New York. In America Kris researched and wrote principally on psychoanalysis. He published various articles on child psychology and was a visiting professor at Yale University School of Medicine. In 1952 he published <u>Psychoanalytic Explorations in Art</u> his last foray into art. A life-long heavy cigarette smoker, he suffered a second and fatal heart attack in 1957.

1223,"Kurz, Otto ",1908,"Vienna, Austria",1975,"London, England, UK","Kurz was the son of a medical doctor, Maximilian Kurz (1871-1941) and Anna Mandel (Kurz) (1884-1941). He attended the humanistiches Gymnasium in Vienna before entering the University of Vienna to study art history in 1927. There he heard lectures by Josef Strzygowski (q.v.) and Hans Tietze (q.v.), eventually completing his dissertation in 1931 under Julius von Schlosser (q.v.) on the topic of the early work of Guido Reni, then a much under-valued artist. For two years he taught a course on conservation at the Institut fĚ_r Ě¦sterreichischen Geschichtsforschung, an institution modeled after the Ě©cole des Chartres. He also volunteered in the main art-history library of Vienna, the Ě¦sterreichisches Museum fĚ_r Kunst und Industrie. Kurz assisted fellow Schlosser student Ernst Kris (q.v.), now a curator at the Kunsthistorisches Museum, on the myths of artists, which appeared as the book <u>Die Legende vom KĚ_nstler</u> in 1933. While still a Schlosser student, Nazi thugs took advantage of the police immunity in the university, bludgeoning Kurz, a Jew, in the middle of the university library. Untimately unable to find work in an Austria evermore aligning itself with Nazi Germany, Schlosser and Kris, helped Kurz secure a job at the private Warburg Library in Hamburg, then under the direction of Fritz Saxl (q.v.). Saxl returned to Vienna only long enough to pass the eleven examinations at the Geschichtsforschung institute (1933). When Saxl moved the Warburg to London, Kurz was invited to emigrate to England as well. In England he completed the first volume of Warburg's <u>Bibliography of the Survival of the Classics</u> (1934). A fellow Schlosser student, the art historian Hilde SchĚ_ller accompanied him and the two were married in 1937 (see Hilde Kurz, q.v.). Kurz was able to find employment editing a critical edition of Marco Polo's <u> Description of the World</u>. His interest in Guido Reni caught the attention of art historian Denis Mahon (q.v.), one of the few Italian baroque enthusiasts in England at the time. Kurz used an introduction from Heinrich Bodmer (q.v.) to assist Mahon with Italian translation and Mahon took Kurz to the Soviet Union to view baroque art. Mahon's contribution to Kurz's salary made it possible for Kurz to survive in England. He completed a book with Hugo Buchthal (q.v.) on Christian manuscripts. In 1939 Saxl secured a two-year grant for Kurz and Gombrich from Sir Percival David (1892-1964). When World War II was declared in Britain, Kurz was interned as an enemy alien. In 1943 he was commission by Anthony Blunt (q.v.) to catalog the collection of Bolognese drawings at Windsor Castle (published 1955). By 1944, Kurz had secured a position as assistant librarian at the Warburg, whose permanent home was now the University of London. He was made Librarian in 1949.Throughout his life, Kurz venerated the memory of his mentor, Schlosser. He updated and translated Schlosser's <u>Kunstliteratur</u> into Italian (1964) and issued a moving personal memoir in 1955. Kurz was so enamored of his teacher that, according to Gombrich, Kurz deleted paragraphs of a draft of his dissertation with pencil marks next to them, assuming they were criticisms by Schlosser, never bothering to ask (they were marks of approval).",Austria;Germany;UK,"Kleinbauer, W.

1232,"Ladner, Gerhart",1905,"Vienna, Austria",1993,"Los Angeles, CA, USA","Medievalist. Ladner was the son of wealthy and cultured Jewish parents of Bohemian decent. His father Oscar Leopold Ladner, was a Viennese factory owner; his mother was Alice Burian (Ladner) (d. 1936). His family vacationed with among others, Sigmund Freud's and he knew Anna Freud well. Ladner attended the Bundesgymnasium XIX in Vienna, graduating in 1924. He early fell under the spell of the poet Stefan George and contemplated a career as a poet. He began studying history, archaeology and general history in 1929 under the so-called Vienna School art historians <a href=""/schlosserj"">Julius von Schlosser</a> and <a href=""/strzygowski"">Josef Strzygowski</a> and <a href=""/swobodak"">Karl Maria Swoboda</a>. At the same time, he studied diplomatics exegesis with the medievalist Hans Hirsch (1878-1940) at the Austrian Institute for Historicial Studies, taking a position the same year at the Monumenta Germaniae Historica, working under its director, the medievalist church historian Paul Fridolin Kehr (1860-1944). Ladner wrote his thesis under Schlosser, <u>Die italienische Malerei im 11. Jahrhunderts</u>, accepted for his Ph.D., in 1930 and published in 1931 and converted from a non-practicing Jew to Roman Catholicism. His first post-doctoral position was in the employ of the Kunsthistorisches Museum, under August Oktav Loehr, cataloging portrait medals. In 1934 he entered the ĚĐsterreichischen Historischen Institut in Rom (Austrian Institute in Rome), where he began his research project on papal portrait iconography in the middle ages. Ladner published his habilitation in 1938, warmly acknowledging Hirsch, on medieval church reform, assuming a <em>privatdozent</em> position at the university in medieval history. With the annexation of Austria in March by Hitler, Ladner had his<em> venia legendi</em> (permission to lecture) withdrawn because he was ""non-Aryan."" He fled the Third Reich the same year to London making contact with the Warburg Institute. He moved to Canada to teach early Christian and medieval art history and history at the Pontifical Institute in Toronto. He rose to assistant professor of medieval history and archaeology in 1940 at the University of Toronto. The first volume of his study of papal portraits, begun in 1934, appeared in 1941. Between 1943 and 1946 he fulfilled Canadian war service in World War II in army intelligence. During this time he married Jocelyn Mary Plummer in 1942 (d. 1980). After the war he resettled in the United States, initially teaching at Notre Dame University in Indiana as assistant and then associate professor. He moved to Howard University in Washington, DC as full professor, 1951, and then Fordham University in 1952. He was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, NJ, 1960-1961, following an initial association in the 1950s. His 1962 Wimmer lecture at UCLA summarized his research on image representation. It was published as <u>Ad Imaginem Dei: The Image of Man in Medieval Art</u> in 1965. In 1963 he accepted a position as professor of art history at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he remained until his emeritus confirmation in 1974. Ladner's early writing shows him engaged in <em>Geistesgeschichte</em>, or the history of spiritual and intellectual ideas, evident in his first articles in 1931 on the history of ideas. His conversion to Roman Catholicism drove his two great research projects, the iconography of the medieval popes and the idea of reform in the middle ages (<u>Speculum</u>). His interdisciplinarity, especially seeing art history in terms of world and cultural history, using a variety of research techniques, is a direct result of Vienna School art historians of the 1930s. Ladner is best known for his <u> Idea of Reform: its Impact on Christian Thought</u>, a ""study of the ways and means employed in medieval civilization to <em>reform</em> culture and politics, both sacred and profane, within an understood sacred order"" (Van Engen, <u>Viator</u>).",Germany;USA,"Kleinbauer, W.

LĚÁnyi's father was ArpĚÁd LĚÁnyi, a Hungarian bureaucrat. The younger LĚÁnyi attended a humanities Gymnasium in Budapest, receiving his <em>Abitur</em> in 1920. Between 1920 and 1924 and again in 1927 he studied art history, archaeology and history in Vienna under the Vienna-School scholar <a href=""/schlosserj"">Julius von Schlosser </a>and then in Munich under <a href=""/pinderw"">Wilhelm Pinder</a>. He wrote a dissertation (likely supervised by Pinder) in Munich on Jacopo della Quercia in 1929. Between 1929 and 1932 he worked as a volunteer researcher for the State Art Museum in Berlin in the graphics collection under <a href=""/friedlanderm"">Max FriedlĚ_nder</a> and at the Kaiser Friedrich-Wilhelm Museum under Thomas Demmler and, particularly important for his later work, the Italian Renaissance sculpture scholar <a href=""/schottmullerf"">Frida SchottmĚ_ller</a>. In 1932 a Swiss benefactor financed a research stay in Florence at the Kunsthistorisches Institut where he worked on a monograph on Donatello. There he met Monika Mann (1910-1992), the daughter of the novelist Thomas Mann (1875-1955), who was studying art history at the time. The 1938 laws against Jews holding academic or museum positions in the Reich made a career in German-speaking countries impossible for him. He emigrated to England in 1938 with Mann where he continued his Donatello research. The two married in 1939. As England became a target for Nazi strikes, his father-in-law, living in Princeton, NJ, used his connections to secure a visa for travel to Canada. The boat carrying them to North America, the ""SS City of Benares"" was torpedoed in the North Atlantic by the German U-boat U-48 and sunk. LĚÁnyi drowned and his wife was injured, but survived. The suitcases containing his notes for his book on Donatello were returned to his widow recovering in Scotland who took them with her to the United States. Two of LĚÁnyi's articles in English appeared posthumously in the <u>Art Bulletin</u> and the <u>Burlington Magazine</u>. His notes and photographs on Donatello was considered so important they were taken over by the New York University Renaissance scholar <a href=""/jansonh"">H. W.

His father was a merchant in Darmstadt. Mayer attended the Neues Gymnasium in Darmstadt, graduating in 1904. He studied art history, archaeolog and <em>Germanistik</em> at the universities at Munich and Berlin. In 1907 he received his Ph.D. from Berlin, writing a dissertation on Jusepe Ribera under Heinrich WĚ¦lfflin (q.v.). He published his thesis as a book the following year. After a year's study travel, mostly in Spain, he took an unpaid position at the Alte Pinakothek in Munich which molted into a position as curator, 1914. During this time he research his habiliation, which allowed him to work as a <em>Privatdozent</em>. In 1920 he was appointed chief conservator and associate professor at the University in Munich. He habilitated the same year. A second edtion of his Ribera book appeared in 1923. With the Nazi's accession to power in 1933, Mayer position at the Pinakothek was in jeopardy because of Jewishness. When the art historian Wilhelm Pinder (q.v.) in a Munich lecture, denounced over a 100 works in the Pinakothek collections as fakes, it was a swipe at Mayer's curatation. Mayer was denounced as well by his students, including the later eminent art historians and National Socialist sympathizers Luitpold Dussler (q.v.) and and Bernhard Degenhart (q.v.). Mayer emigrated to France, working as the editor of the art journal <u>Pantheon</u> the same year and doing other writing. When France was overrun by the Nazis in 1940, Mayer fled to Cannes, France. However, he was arrested by the Gestapo, apparently during a sojour to Paris, and deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1943. He perished there in 1944.

1477,"Middeldorf, Ulrich",1901,"Stassfurt am Bode, Saxony, Germany",1983,"Florence, Italy","Professor and chair of the Department of Art, University of Chicago; historian of Italian Renaissance sculpture. Middeldorf was the son of Hans Middeldorf, a mining engineer, and Meta Zuckerschwerdt (Middeldorf). His family was of Dutch ancestry. Middeldorf began his study of art history in 1920-1921 initially under Heinrich WĚ¦lfflin (q.v.), already retired, and August Liebmann Mayer (q.v.) at the University of Munich. His dissertation, written under Adolph Goldschmit (q.v.) in Berlin, centered on late medieval sculpture, <u>Die Entwicklung der thĚ_ringische-sĚ_chsische Plastik seit etwa 1250 bis 1350</u>. Berlin, with its spectacular collections at the Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum, also gave him an enthusiasm for Italian Renaissance sculpture and medals. He spent 1924-1926 as a Fellow and the Keeper of the photography collection (the <i> Fototeca</i>) at the Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florence and assisting Richard Offner (q.v.) in the <u>Corpus of Florentine Painting</u>. Middeldorf visited London frequently and made the acquaintance of its director, Sir George Hill (q.v.). A vocal opponent to Nazism, Middeldorf emigrated to the United States in 1935 to become an Assistant Professor of Art History at the University of Chicago at the personal recommendation of Bernard Berenson (q.v.). He remained at the University, eventually becoming chair, until 1953. His legendary Chicago department included Joshua Taylor (q.v.) and Otto von Simson (q.v.). Middeldorf concomitantly was honorary curator of sculpture at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1941-1953, where he was responsible for several major acquisitions. From 1953-1968, he served as the Director of the Kunsthistoriches Institut in Florence, where he worked to increase its reputation as an institution of sound art historical scholarship. A skilled administrator, Middeldorf raised funds locusing the institution on solid financial grounds. He also moved the institution to new quarters, doubled the size of the library and opened the doors to scholars of all nations. His Chicago students included Seymour Slive (q.v.), Bates Lowry (q.v.), Peter Selz (q.v.) and Francis Dowley (q.v.). Middeldorf distinguished himself among American academics as one particularly devoted to the studying works of art in their original, eschewing a reliance on illustrations. His many writings indicate a broad knowledge of art <em>in situ</em>. His written contribution lacked the single specialized monograph on a topic that is a staple among academics. Though his writing was extremely diverse within the history of art, it was limited to extensive catalog entries and articles. As a teacher, he was known to be aloof except to his graduate students.",Germany;USA,"Wendland, Ulrike. <u>Biographisches Handbuch deutschsprachiger Kunsthistoriker im Exil: Leben und Werk der unter dem Nationalsozialismus verfolgten und vertriebenen Wissenschaftler</u>.

1535,"MĚ_nz, Ludwig",1889,"Vienna, Austria",1957,"Munich, Germany","Professor of Art History at the Vienna Academy, Director of its gallery; Rembrandt scholar. MĚ_nz's father and mother were Bernhard MĚ_nz, Chief editor for the <u>Neue Wiener Tagblatt</u> (newspaper) and Josefine Labin (MĚ_nz). After graduation from a humanities Gymnasium in Vienna, MĚ_nz entered the University in Vienna around 1908 concentrating on a law degree. He enlisted in the Austrian army in 1912 and was assigned to the reserves. Returning to the University, he completed his law degree in 1914 and, already having begun a study of art history, planned to pursue it next. The eruption of World War I, however, resulted in his recall to the army. He fought with distinction and was wounded in action. After the war, he resumed study in Vienna under Max Dvo�ŞĚÁk (q.v.). Dvo�ŞĚÁk died in 1921 andMĚ_nz moved to the University of Hamburg and its connections with the Warburg Library under Fritz Saxl (q.v.) and Erwin Panofsky (q.v.). He continued to research a dissertation topic on Rembrandt's influence in eighteenth-century art. His attempt to graduate at Hamburg in 1923 was thwarted by the faculty who failed to accept his dissertation, partially due to issues of antisemitism (Wendland). MĚ_nz published his first article, one on the drawings of Rembrandt and Bols, in 1924. He returned to Vienna in 1926 teaching a private teacher and supported by his family. In 1931 he edited the critical edition of the important book, <u>Das hollĚ_ndische GruppenportrĚ_t</u> (The Dutch Portrait Group) by Alois Riegl (q.v.) and, after 1933, the literary estate of his friend, the Viennese architect Adolf Loos (1870-1933). MĚ_nz reorganized the antiquities collection of the Kunstgewerbemuseum (Arts and Industry Museum) in Vienna with Ernst von Garger, which was regarded as a model of its kind (<u>Burlington Magazine</u>). He became close acquaintences of the influential Vienna mayor Karl Krauss and Oskar Kokoschka. MĚ_nz harbored an interest in the psychology of art and particularly of artistic creation. After five years of study, his book on how blind children create sculpture, <u>Die plastischen Arbeiten Blinder</u>, appeared in 1934 with the art education Viktor LĚ¦wenfeld (1903-1960). He married Maria Fijala Zornig in 1937. He produced another innovative books, <u>Die Kunst Rembrandts und Goethes Sehen</u>, on Goethe's interpretation of Rembrandt's art. MĚ_nz's opposition to National Socialism--intellectual and religious (he was Jewish)--was overt before the 1938 Anschluss. After then, he escaped Austria to England with the help of friends. He taught and wrote, but was supported by his fellow countryman in England, Count Antoine Seilern (q.v.). He continued special-subjects research on the drawing of mental patients at Maudsley Mental Hospital in London. At the outbreak of the war with England, MĚ_nz was interned in 1940 as an enemy alien, released in 1941 by the Warburg Institute, now resituated in London. During the war MĚ_nz researched Rembrandt etchings and those of his followers At the conclusion of World War II, MĚ_nz was recalled to Austria by the ministry of education to be the director of the academy of fine arts. He set about rebuilding the Academy, figuratively and literally from war damage. He set about organizing exhibitions and writing guides for the public which were both scholarly and introductory. His book on Rembrandt etchings was published in 1952 as a two-volume set; it remains a significant work on the artist's drawings and MĚ_nz's major work. In 1954 he was selected to publish the volume on Rembrandt for the Abrams series on individual artsts, <u>Library of Great Painters</u>. He was awarded the title of Professor in 1955 by the Austrian President. Shorty after opening a discussion session at Rembrandt congress at the Zentralinstitut fĚ_r Kunstgeschichte, MĚ_nz suffered a heart attack and died before many of his colleagues. His book on the drawings of Pieter Bruegel was published posthumously. MĚ_nz had the reputation of being a difficult personality.

1613,"PĚ_cht, Otto  ",07 September 1902,"Vienna, Austria ",17-Apr-88,"Vienna, Austria  ","Medievalist of the (second) Vienna School art historian. PĚ_cht was a native Viennese. Robert Musil (1880-1942) and Oskar Kokoschka (1886-1980) were among his friends. He attended one of the 'Humanistisches Staatsgymnasium' in the city and in 1920 entered university in Vienna. Unlike his colleagues and the Germanic higher education model where students moved from university to university to attend classes, PĚ_cht remained in Vienna except for one semester in Berlin (studying with <a href=""/goldschmidta"">Adolph Goldschmidt</a>) and some contact with <a href=""/pinderw"">Wilhelm Pinder</a> in Leipzig. His principal faculty in Vienna were the major forces in the so-called second or new ""Vienna School"" of art history: <a href=""/dvorakm"">Max Dvo�ŞĚÁk</a>, <a href=""/swobodak"">Karl Maria Swoboda</a> whose assistant he was, and <a href=""/schlosserj"">Julius von Schlosser</a>, the latter supervising his dissertation on medieval painting in 1925. PĚ_cht and his colleague, <a href=""/sedlmayrh"">Hans Sedlmayr</a> formed the nucleus of this generation of Vienna School theorists, reinventing the methodology of <a href=""/riegla"">Alois Riegl</a> to counter the prevailing art history trend of empirical attention to 'facts' such as iconography and social history. PĚ_cht edited and revised a second edition of Riegl's <u>SpĚ_trĚ¦mischen Kunstindustrie</u> in 1927. Between 1926-1930 he co-edited the new serial <u>Kritische Berichte zur kunstgeschichtlichen Literatur</u> and in 1931 and 1933 edited the first (and only) two issues of <u>Kunstwissenschaftliche Forschungen</u>, the vehicle for the theories of himself and Sedlmayr. His <em>habilitationsschrift</em> on the fifteenth-century painter Michael Pacher, was completed under <a href=""/grisebacha"">August Grisebach</a> in Heidelberg in 1932 and published in the <u>Forschungen</u>. It is a sterling example of the new Vienna School's method of discerning a structure within the work which then becomes a window to the painter's worldview. PĚ_cht, a Jew, had his status as a <em>privatdozent</em> revoked when the Nazi's came to power in Germany in 1933 and returned to Vienna. He broke with Sedlmayr, who had joined the Nazi party. In 1935 he accompanied Musil to the anti-fascist congress in Vienna for the defense of culture. Shortly before Austria's annexation in 1938, PĚ_cht accepted an invitation from <a href=""/furlongg"">George Furlong</a>, director of the National Gallery of Ireland. Between 1937-1941 he researched at the Warburg Institute. As Britain entered World War II, PĚ_cht was interned in 1940. That same year he married British subject Jeane Michalopulo. In England, PĚ_cht cataloged manuscripts for the Bodleian Library, Oxford, and from 1945 was appointed honorary lecturer for medieval art at Oriel College, Oxford. In 1950 was made University Lecturer, 1952 senior lecturer. He spent the academic year 1956-1957 at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, NJ, and subsequent years as a visiting professor at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University, and as a Reader at Oxford. PĚ_cht, however, never fully acclimated to the English-speaking scholarly community and never secured a permanent position in his expatriate lands. He returned to his native Vienna at the invitation of <a href=""/#"">Otto Demus</a> to be Professor at the University in 1963. From 1969 he headed the Department of Manuscripts of the Austrian national library. He was made <em>emeritus</em> of the university in 1972. Students he greatly influenced at Oxford included the British medievalist <a href=""/beckwithj"">John Beckwith</a> and <a href=""/cahnw"">Walter Cahn</a>.   In his lifetime, PĚ_cht was little known outside the German-speaking scholarly world. His method, most clearly outlined in his <u>Practice of Art History</u> lectures, relied on the concept of <em>Gestaltungsprinzip</em> or the design principle revealing the structure of the work of art and social meaning intended by the artist. These structures could be as diverse as pictorial elements or figure/ground relationships. PĚ_cht contrasted this view to the emphasis art historians of the medieval and renaissance art placed on iconography or patronage history. PĚ_cht's approach was well-suited to his topics of manuscript illumination and northern renaissance painting. He used Riegl's notion that style is relative and subject to artistic intent. He argued that medieval art lacks the verisimilitude of either the classical period or the Renaissance largely because it intends to represent miracles of God rather than the rationality of the world. PĚ_cht's fight against the hegemony of iconographic studies was lifelong. His 1956 review of Panofsky's <u>Early Netherlandish Painting</u> was infamous for the critique he placed at the feet of iconographers who practiced their craft with almost no resistance in the United States and England. An anti-romantic to the extreme, PĚ_cht resisted the notion of artist as genius, even when his teachers such as Schlosser embraced it in their own writings. He criticized the work of <a href=""/kuhnh"">Herbert KĚ_hn</a> as ""impressionistic"" and the methods of <a href=""/friedlanderm"">Max J. FriedlĚ_nder.</a> Likewise he chided what he saw as the ""intuitive criticism,"" of <a href=""/fraengerw"">Wilhelm Fraenger</a> and <a href=""/lutzelerh"">Heinrich LĚ_tzeler</a>. Though he never forgave Sedlmayr for his participation in Nazism, he wrote toward the end of his life that Sedlmayr had contributed more to the methodology of art than anyone else in our time (<u>Methodisches zur Kunstgeschichten Praxis</u>). PĚ_cht tended to be less reliant on documentary sources, placing a greater emphasis on stylistic criticism and structural analysis.

1624,"Panofsky, Erwin",30 March 1892,"Hanover, Germany",14-Mar-68,"Princeton, NJ, USA","Warburg Institute and Institute for Advanced Study art historian; major exponent of iconography to American scholars. Panofsky was the son of Arnold Panofsky (d. 1914) and Caecilie Solling (Panofsky), wealthy Jews whose fortune came from Silesian mining. He was raised in Berlin, receiving his <i>Abitur</i> in 1910 at the Joachimsthalsche Gymnasium. He spent the years 1910-1914 studying philosophy, philology and art history in Jura, Berlin (where he heard lectures of the art historian <a href=""/bieberm"">Margarete Bieber</a>, who was filling in for <a href=""/loeschckeg"">Georg Loeschcke</a>), and in Munich. While taking courses at Freiburg UniversitĚ_t, a slightly older student, <a href=""/badtk"">Kurt Badt</a>, took Panofsky to hear a lecture by the founder of the art history department, <a href=""/vogew"">Wilhelm VĚ¦ge</a>. Panofsky was at once enamored and wrote his dissertation under VĚ¦ge in 1914. His topic, DĚ_rer's artistic theory (<u>DĚ_rers Kunsttheorie:  vornehmlich in ihrem Verhaltnis zur Kunsttheorie der Italiener</u>) was  published the following year in Berlin as <u>Die Theoretische Kunstlehre  Albrecht DĚ_rers</u>. Because of horse-riding accident, he was exempt from military service during World War I. Instead, he attended the seminars of the medievalist <a href=""/goldschmidta"">Adolph Goldschmidt</a> in Berlin. He married Dorothea ""Dora"" Mosse (1885-1965), also an art historian from a wealthy family, in 1916. In 1920 his <i>habilitation</i> was accepted in Hamburg on the topic of Michelangelo, the manuscript only rediscovered in 2012. His <i>habilitation</i> in hand, Panofsky was called to chair the art history department of the newly established University of Hamburg in 1920. His first graduate student was <a href=""/winde"">Edgar Wind</a>.  The decade of the 1920s was one of brilliant writing. In Hamburg, Panofsky formed part of a group of cultural intellectuals. He developed an intimate intellectual circle with <a href=""/saxlf"">Fritz Saxl</a> with whom he published a 1923 monograph on DĚ_rer's <u>Melencholia I</u>, <a href=""/warburga"">Aby Warburg</a>, and the philosopher and art theorist <a href=""/cassirere"">Ernst Cassier</a>, centered around Warburg's Institute (see Warburg entry). Panofsky, a ""young, witty, acerbic, conceited genius"" according to one student, <a href=""/hecksherw"">William Hecksher</a>, developed an immediate student following. Two early papers, ""Der Begriff des Kunstwollens,"" (1920) and ""ĚĎber das Verhaltnis der Kunstgeschichte zur Kunsttheorie,"" (1925) demonstrate Panofsky's theoretical heritage to Cassirer and <a href=""/riegla"">AloĚřs Riegl</a>. In 1924, his book <u>Idea</u> was published, a discussion of the ideas of the intellect vis-ĚĘ-vis the imitations of the world of perception. His overt intelligence won him the first full professor of art history at Hamburg (<i>ordentlicher  Professor</i>) in 1926. In 1927 he published <u>Perspektive als  symbolische Form</u>, a dazzling blend of personal theoretics and wide-ranging knowledge of Renaissance art and thought, built around Cassirer's neo-Kantian theories of ""symbolic forms."" In the academic year 1931-1932, Panofsky paid a visit to the United States representing Warburg's think tank, the Kulturwissenschaftliche Bibliothek Warburg and teaching at New York University.  The Nazis' assumption of power in Germany forced Jews out of academic positions; Panofsky returned to Germany in the summer of 1933 to supervise oral examinations and dissertations for his remaining students before permanently emigrated to the United States in 1934. He published his most famous article, an analysis of the Arnolfini portrait by Jan van Eyck, in the <u>Burlington  Magazine</u> the same year. After a year teacing at New York University, Panofsky became the first permanent professor of the School of Historical Studies of the newly founded Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, NJ, a private research center near Princeton University created so that Jewish scholars (primarily) could work near the University, but not as faculty. Panofsky's move from Hamburg to the United States coincided with a methodological transformation. In Panofsky's early career, he experimented with various approaches to his subject. By the time he had settled in Princeton, he had arrived at the ""conviction that the methodological problems with which he had once grappled had been successfully resolved."" (Moxey, p. 93). In 1939 Panofsky published <u>Studies in Iconology:  Humanist Themes in the Art of the Renaissance</u>, book which, among other essays, argued for the distinction between <i>iconology</i> and <i>iconography</i>. His 1943 book on Albrecht DĚ_rer, combined many of his published ideas on the artist together with a sharp intuitive eye to DĚ_rer's prints. Panofsky next issued a primary-source document and commentary on the Abbot Suger and the founding of the Gothic style, <u>Abbot Suger on the Abbey  Church of St.-Denis</u>, in 1946. <u>Gothic Architecture and Scholasticism</u> appeared in 1951, a book about Parisian architectural relationships with the principles of a scholastic <i>summa</i>. His 1947-1948 Charles Eliot Norton lectures at Harvard appeared as the 2-volume monograph on northern Renaissance art, <u>Early Netherlandish Painting</u>, in 1953. It was a detailed iconographical study demonstrating how works of visual realism could incorporate elaborate Christian symbolism convincingly.  Among the book's many revelations was the discovery that the famous Arnolfini double portrait by Jan van Eyck was a wedding document.  <a href=""/leer"">Rensselaer Lee</a>, chair of the Department of Art and Archaeology at Princeton University from 1956, convinced Panofsky to begin teaching regularly at the University as well. Panofsky's work at the Institute for Advanced Study attracted other art historians to study with him. These included Heckscher in 1936, <a href=""/grodeckil"">Louis Grodecki</a> in 1951, <a href=""/gelderj"">Jan van Gelder</a>, 1953, and <a href=""/delaissel"">LĚ©on ""Bob"" DelaissĚ©</a> in 1959. He presented Gottesman lectures at Uppsala University which appeared in 1960 as the book <u> Renaissance and Renascences in Western Art</u>. The lectures posed the (now) generally accepted notion that smaller ""renaissances"" (re-births) of the classical happened periodically in medieval art and literature before the major one in Italy. He retired from the Institute <i>emeritus</i> in 1963 and was succeeded by <a href=""/meissm"">Millard Meiss</a>. Panofsky was immediately appointed Samuel Morse Professor of Fine Arts at New York University. His lectures there resulted in the 1964 book <u>Tomb Sculpture</u>. His wife, Dora, died in 1965 and the 73-year-old Panofsky married the 36-year-old art historian Gerda Soergel [SĚ¦rgel] (b.1929) the following year. Two years later he suffered a series of heart attacks and died. Panofsky's posthumous literary output continued for twenty years. Gerda Panofsky-Soergel continued to update his Abbot Suger book. The six Wrightsman lectures he delivered at the Metropolitan Museum of Art were issued as <u>Problems in  Titian, Mostly Iconographic</u> in 1969. His collected essays appeared in 1995. A son, Wolfgang Panofsky (1919-2007), was a Manhattan-Project physicist and Nobel-Prize winner. Panofsky's many students, in addition to Heckscher and Wind, included <a href=""/buchthalh"">Hugo Buchthal</a>, <a href=""/breitenbache"">Edgar Breitenbach</a>, <a href=""/auerbachi"">Ingeborg Fraenckel Auerbach</a>, <a href=""/jansonh"">H. W. Janson</a>, <a href=""/foersterl"">Lotte Brand Philip Foerster</a>, <a href=""/hoffu"">Ursula Hoff</a>, <a href=""/kochra"">Robert A. Koch</a>, and <a href=""/hornw"">Walter W. Horn</a>.  His papers are housed at the Archives of American Art, Washington, DC. In 2012, his habilitation, thought to have been lost was discoverd at the Zentralinstitut fĚ_r Kunstgeschichte in files of the founding director, <a href=""/heydenreichl"">Ludwig H. Heydenreich</a> Though Panofsky is considered the ""ur-iconologist,"" his methodology was diverse and is difficult to summarize. Primarily a scholar of medieval and northern Renaissance art, he is most frequently associated with the concept of iconography, matching the subject-matter of works of art to a symbolic syntax of meaning drawn from literature and other art works. His work broadened into a theory of iconology; what <a href=""/bazing"">Germain Bazin</a> characterized as ""the work of art as a 'symptom'"" (Bazin 217). However, Panofsky was a broad thinker (in the tradition of Cassirer) whose work evolved over a period of time. Another acknowledged debt was to Riegl, the Austrian art historian who espoused the notion of <i>Kunstwollen</i>. Panofsky's notion of perspective as a metaphor in Renaissance art occupied his thinking for an extended period (and resulted in at least one full book). He contended that theories of proportion were generally too elaborate to be applied uniformly to actual works of art. Panofsky's iconology did not preclude a sensitivity for formal considerations or style. The conceptual framework of any period, he wrote, is always subservient to the underlying the style of the art. His use of iconology as the principle tool of art analysis brought him critics. In 1946, van Gelder criticized Panofsky's iconology as putting too much emphasis on the symbolic content of the work of art, neglecting its formal aspects and the work as a unity of form and content. <a href=""/pachto"">Otto PĚ_cht</a>, the Vienna art historian, pointed out in a celebrated book review in 1956 using the case of the van Eyck <u>Arnolfini and his Wife</u> painting, that iconology would elucidate this important work very little. Indeed, Panofsky's conclusions on this double portrait were essentially overturned in 1998 by Lorne Campbell. Panofsky himself had mixed feelings about the success of his method (Cassidy). A scholar who rejoiced in learning and his own mastery, he wrote at times to his medievalist colleagues in Latin (Hourihan).",Germany;USA,"[the literature on Panofsky is legion.

1658,"Pevsner, Nikolaus Bernard Leon, Sir",30 January 1902,"Leipzig, Saxony, Germany",1983,"Hampstead Heath, London, England, UK","Architectural historian in Britain and founder of the <u>Pelican History of Art</u> and <u>The Buildings of England</u> series. Pevsner was brought up in the fashionable ""Music Quarter"" of Leipzig by Russian-Jewish parents Hillel Pewsner, later Hugo Pevsner (1869-1940), and Anna Perlmann (Pevsner) (d. 1942); his father was a fur importer. Hugo's absence in Sweden during the years of World War I allowed the young Pevsner to attend the Thomasschule (the same school at which Bach played the organ), converting to Christianity in 1920 and receiving his <i>Arbitur</i> in 1921. He had already visited England, where his maternal grandparents lived. His university <i>Wanderjahren</i> of 1921-1924 took him to various German universities and eminent art faculty. These included the universities of Munich and <a href=""/wolfflinh"">Heinrich WĚ¦lfflin</a>, Berlin and <a href=""/goldschmidta"">Adolph Goldschmidt</a>, and Frankfurt and <a href=""/kautzschr"">Rudolf Kautzsch</a> before finally returning to settle upon Leipzig to write his dissertation in 1924 under the magnetic <a href=""/pinderw"">Wilhelm Pinder</a>. His thesis topic was on the baroque architecture of Leipzig. Among his early influences (books he read multiple times during this period) included <u>L'art religieux</u> by <a href=""/malee"">Emile MĚ˘le</a>, <u>Handbuch der deutschen Geschichte</u> by Bruno Gebhardt (1858-1905), and <u>Das Mittelalter bis zum Ausgange der KreuzzĚ_ge</u> by Siegmund Hellmann (1872-1942). Pevsner married Karola (Lola) Kurlbaum (d. 1963) in 1923, the daughter of a distinguished Berlin lawyer. Leaving Leipzig in 1924, he worked as an unpaid assistant curator for five years at the GemĚ_ldegalerie, contributing art criticism to the <u>Dresdner Anzeiger</u>. In 1925, Pevsner experienced Walter Gropius' Bauhaus building in Dessau and Le Corbusier's <i>Pavillon de L'Esprit Nouveau</i> at the Paris Exhibition, two events that changed his career. His dissertation appeared in print as <u>Barockmalerei in den romanischen LĚ_ndern</u>, the first volume of a two-part set on Italian painting, the second written by <a href=""/grautoffo"">Otto Grautoff</a>, and both as volume 25 of the prestigious <u>Handbuch der Kunstwissenschaft</u> series begun by <a href=""/burgerf"">Fritz Burger</a>. Pevsner moved to GĚ_ttingen as a <i> privatdozent</i> in 1928, where he published his <i>Habilitionschrift</i> in 1929, assisting the faculty there, including the chair, <a href=""/vitzthumg"">Georg (Graf) Vitzthum von EckstĚ_dt</a>. Pevsner was granted funding to travel to England to study that country's art. Though of Jewish parentage, Pevsner was an enthusiast of Hitler's proposals for regenerating Germany economically and rebuilding its international status. Even after Hitler's ascension to power in 1933 and the dismissal of Pevsner (and most Jews in academic positions in Germany), Pevsner wrote articles suggesting an accommodation with Nazism. Pevsner used his connections in Britain to secure a two-year fellowship, tendered by Philip Sargant Florence (1890-1982) in the Department of Commerce at Birmingham University in 1934, all the while reapplying for positions in Germany despite the warnings of his friends. The following year, the Cotswold furniture designer Sir Gordon Russell (1892-1980) created a job of Pevsner in fabric purchasing. Certain now that he would never find work in Germany, Pevsner sent for his family. In 1936 Pevsner published his first English-language book, <u>Pioneers of the Modern Movement</u>, the result of his GĚ_ttingen research trip in the 1920s. He also started writing for the <u> Architectural Review</u>, under James Richards. When Britain declared war on Germany in 1939, Pevsner spent a short amount of time in a Liverpool internment camp. But Pevsner's connections were so well developed that his release was arranged by the Vice-chairman of the London Passenger Transport Board, Frank Pick (1878-1941), along with Josiah Wedgwood (1899-1968), and <a href=""/clarkk"">Kenneth Clark</a>, of the National Gallery. Pevsner's book <u>Academies of Art</u> appeared in 1940, dedicated to Pinder. When Richards took a leave of absence on the <u>Architectural Review</u>, Pevsner became acting editor. That year, too, the founder of Penguin Books, Allen Lane (1902-1970), commissioned Pevsner to write the <u>Outline of European Architecture</u> and placed him in charge of his <u>King Penguin</u> book series. A long association between Pevsner and Penguin Books began. News reached Pevsner that his mother, who refused to leave Germany, had committed suicide in order not to be sent to a concentration camp. In 1942, Pevsner was given a lectureship teaching art history at Birkbeck College, London University's night school for mature students in day-time employment. In spite of his commitments to Birkbeck, Pevsner pursued an association with Penguin Books. In 1945 Lane immediately accepted Pevsner's proposal to write and edit the <u>Buildings of England</u> series, based on the guidebook model of <a href=""/dehiog"">Georg Dehio</a> in Germany. Pevsner received British citizenship in 1946. Sensing Lane's eagerness to publish scholarly art to a lay audience, Pevsner suggested an English version of Burger's <u>Handbuch</u>, which Pevsner would edited. The result was Pevsner's <u>Pelican History of Art</u>, the first volumes of which appeared in 1953. Pevsner's popularity, politics and journalistic tendencies rankled other members of the German expatiate community in Britain, particularly those connected with the Warburg Institute. Throughout their careers, Pevsner had a cool relationship with <a href=""/gombriche"">Ernst Gombrich</a>, <a href=""/saxlf"">Fritz Saxl</a>, <a href=""/wittkowerr"">Rudolf Wittkower</a> and <a href=""/winde"">Edgar Wind</a>, particularly because Pevsner had dedicated his <u>Academies of Art</u> to Pinder, whose pro-Nazi sentiments had included advising the Nazis on art works to loot. In 1946, after a few unsuccessful attempts at BBC broadcasting, Pevsner delivered programs on the ""Third Programme,"" a broadcasting arm of the BBC aimed at elevating the content of the BBC's broadcasts. Pevsner gave nine talks between 1946 and 1950 examining painters and European art eras. During the same period, he was Slade Professor at Cambridge (1949-1955). Pevsner eventually delivered more than seventy-eight talks for the BBC up to 1977, including the BBC's flagship Reith Lectures for 1955. In 1958, he co-chaired the nascent Victorian Society, which he held until 1976. In 1959 Birkbeck College upgraded Pevsner's lectureship into a full professorship and he went on to receive numerous awards as well as sitting on a number of influential advisory committees on art, architecture and education. In 1963, while he was in the United States to accept Yale University's Howland Memorial Prize, his wife, Karola (""Lola""), died suddenly in England of an embolism of the lung. His project for the <u>Buildings of England</u> weighed heavily on him now and his vision for a Bauhaus in England, the new Dessau, was slipping away. He retired from Birbeck in 1967, succeeded by <a href=""/murrayp"">Peter Murray</a>. Pevsner taught as the Slade Professor of art at Oxford, 1968-1969. He spent his final years lecturing and traveling, continuing to edit the <u>Buildings of England</u> and <u>Pelican History of Art</u>. His students included <a href=""/banhamr"">Reyner Banham</a>. Pevsner's work owes much to Pinder. His use in the <u>Outline of European Architecture</u> of <i>Zeitgeist</i> notions, the characterizing of Spain as a ""restless country"" or Germany as possessing a more authentic architecture (compared to Italy), is derived from Pinder's use of nationalizing of artistic intent. The appreciation and inclusion of Baroque monuments in the <u>Outline</u> reveals the pioneering work of <a href=""/brinckmanna"">Albert Brinckmann</a>. Pevsner's early book on Italian painting for the <u>Handbuch</u> sought to raise the period of Mannerism as an important era in painting, and not simply the ""dry years"" between the renaissance and the baroque. In the 1970s increasing doubts emerged about his methodology as an architectural historian and about his objectivity as an architectural critic, particularly in view of his fierce loyalty to Gropius and modernism. Deborah Howard cites Pevsner as claiming in his writing ""a single stylistic genealogy from Pugin to Modernism [for British architecture]."" David Watkin, briefly a Ph.D. student of Pevsner's at Cambridge, attacked Pevsner in Watkin's 1977 book <u>Morality and Architecture</u> for insisting that only modernist-style architecture was valid for contemporary design. Pevsner's espousal of Nazi policies and dogmatic writing also remains problematic for his reputation.  When his pre-war <u>Pioneers of the Modern Movement</u> was republished by the Museum of Modern Art in 1949, some of the book's totalitarian rhetoric--including the title--was toned down to make it more acceptable. Peter Kidson described Pevsner's <u>Pelican  History of Art</u> project as an example of the decline in methodological belief, characteristic, Kidson contended, of many older post-war art historians who considered the primary tasks of art history as having been accomplished, now only needing summarization. <a href=""/francastelp"">Pierre Francastel</a> chided him for attributing too much to his adopted country, England, in architecture, particularly the effect of the Arts & Crafts movement.",Germany;UK,"Kleinbauer, W.

Little is known about RaphaĚÇl's early life. His parents were Jewish, his father's last name was Schneider; his mother died in 1900 when RaphaĚÇl was 11. After graduating from high school in Berlin, he studied jurisprudence and political economy with Gustav von Schmoller (1838-1917) in Berlin and with Lujo Brentano (1844-1931) in MĚ_nich. He began taking courses in Berlin in sociology under Georg Simmel (1858-1918), art history under <a href=""/malee"">Emile MĚ˘le</a> and philosophy under Henri-Louis Bergson (1859-1941) in Paris and art history again under <a href=""/wolfflinh"">Heinrich WĚ¦lfflin</a> in Munich. In Munich he also encountered German Expressionist artists Paul Klee, Franz Marc, of the <em>Blaue Reiter</em> and August Macke, and Max Pechstein of <em>Die BrĚ_cke</em>. His Paris travel in 1911 led to the acquaintance of Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse and Auguste Rodin. Enthused by French art, he returned to Munich to write his thesis--not accepted by WĚ¦lfflin--in 1913 on the development of modern art from Monet to Picasso. As a book, it went through three editions before 1919. His attempts at graduation thwarted, RaphaĚÇl moved to Bodman am Bodensee, Germany, working as an independent writer. He began developing a sociological theory to interpret art history. RaphaĚÇl entered the German army in 1915 to fight in World War I, deserting in 1917 and fleeing to Switzerland. He resumed writing, but was expelled from Switzerland in 1920, resettling in Berlin. An art primer, <u>Idee un Gestalt</u>, written in 1919, appeared in 1921. In 1924, RaphaĚÇl was appointed professor at the Volkhochschule in Berlin, teaching laboring men and women art history and occasional courses in mathematics and biology. His art lectures from his courses were posthumously published as <u>The Demands of Art</u>. RaphaĚÇl's courses were imbued with his particular brand of Marxist and sociological methodology. During this time he published articles and a book on the doric temples in 1930. The rise of the Nazi party and their staunch anti-communist, anti-semitic policies caused him to flee Germany. Initially he returned to Switzerland in 1932, then France in 1933, working on his essay ""Empirischen Kunstwissenschaft"" (The Empirical Study of Art) and publishing his best known book, <u>Proudhon, Marx, Picasso: trois Ě©tudes sur la sociologie de l'art</u>, the same year. He pursued this topic with the art historian and fellow WĚ¦lfflin student Hanna Levy Deinhard (1912-1984). In 1940 after the German occupation of Paris, RaphaĚÇl was interned at the camp at Gurs. He married Emma Dietz in 1941 and was moved to the camp at Les Milles, Aix-en-Provence. The same year he slipped into Barcelona and then Lisbon where he was able to emigrate to the United States, his wife remaining in the Gurs internment camp until 1945. After the war, the couple reunited and they both lived off of her meager earnings as an office cleaner. In New York, RaphaĚÇl studied principally early ancient art and authoring a manuscript on the rise of German industry. He published a book on cave painting in 1945 and another on Egyptian pottery in 1947. RaphaĚÇl committed suicide in 1952 in New York. As an art historian, RaphaĚÇl's reputation was built on his large posthumous publication and reprint legacy. He became the model for Marxist art historians of the later twentieth century (Doy). His methodology was based on what he considered a scientific (""empirical"") approach to art rather than a sociological one (Tagg). He asserted that everything necessary to analyze the work of art could (and should) be gleaned from the elements in the picture alone. This visual reading, however, was not formalistic. RaphaĚÇl's visual reading was imbued with the implicit actions of the figure and subject from a psychological and class-based criteria of the subject and viewer. This approach was ""inside-out"" dialectics from contemporary Marxist esthetic theory (Truitt). This phenomenological view of artistic comprehension RaphaĚÇl derived from the writings of Husserl. Art, he insisted, had to be be viewed (""reconstructed"") anew without background context or facts. Later art historians admired his approach for taking the object itself as the starting point to analysis and mapping to a cultural context secondary. RaphaĚÇl's Marxism was primarily intellectual; he was not politically engaged, believing that his writings could change society (Doy). Apropos to his keeping esthetics and social context separate, his book <u>The Demands of Art</u> was envisioned in two parts: the first, a detailed analysis of works of art and a second (never completed), to deal with the economic/historic framework. RaphaĚÇl's legacy is that he fused a Marxist dialectic with sociology, political economy, art history, and philosophical aesthetics into a single methodology. Socialist countries ignored his work (except for Poland and Bulgaria) because his theory was not compatible with official Socialist Realism. In the United States, the art historian Hanna Deinhard adopted his methodology in her 1970 work <u>Meaning and Expression</u> and John Berger (q.v.) dedicated his book <u>The Success and Failure of Picasso</u> (1965) to RaphaĚÇl.",Germany;USA,"Truitt, Willis.

1786,"Rewald, John",1912,"Berlin, Germany",1994,"New York, NY, USA","Scholar of Impressionism and CĚ©zanne; wrote first scholarly synthesis of Impressionism in the English language. Rewald's father was Bruno Albert Rewald (b. 1885), a chemist, and mother Paula Feinstein (Rewald) (1880-1964) a dentist. He was educated at the Lichtwark School in Hamburg, receiving his <em>Abitur</em> in 1931. He spent the years 1931-1936 studying art history at various universities, including Hamburg under <a href=""/panofskye"">Erwin Panofsky</a> and <a href=""/saxlf"">Fritz Saxl</a>, and Frankfurt. Rewald entered the Sorbonne in 1932 ostensibly for a year's study, but after Hitler's rise the following year in Germany, he was compelled to remain in France as an exile. While rambling through France visiting the rural cathedrals, Rewald met fellow German Leo Marchutz, a painter who was searching out the landscapes of Paul CĚ©zanne's work. Rewald and Marchutz joined forces, Rewald photographing the landscapes used in CĚ©zanne's pictures. (These photographs later became the shots for Rewald's book on Post Impressionism). At the Sorbonne, he convinced <a href=""/focillonh"">Henri Focillon</a> to allow him to write his dissertation on CĚ©zanne, an artist considered too recent to be a subject of study. Rewald's dissertation, <u>CĚ©zanne</u><u> et Zola</u>, addressed the friendship between the two creative personalities. Between 1936-1941 he worked as a journalist for various newspapers writing art criticism. He married Estelle Haimovici in 1939. When France declared war on Germany, he was interned in 1939 as an enemy alien--despite being Jewish. He emigrated to the United States in 1941. Rewald was awarded the Prix Charles Blanc in 1940 in France for his dissertation, <i>in absentia</i>. In New York, where Museum of Modern Art Director <a href=""/barra"">Alfred Barr, Jr.</a> had sponsored Rewald's immigration, Rewald initially found work at Weyhe's Book Shop and in 1942 for the War Department as a French interpreter. Beginning in 1943, he consulted for the Museum of Modern Art, New York, organizing exhibitions for it and other museums and researching his magnum opus, a history of Impressionism. Rewald had shown Barr a mass of unpublished CĚ©zanne correspondence that Rewald had collected for his dissertation in France. Barr asked his former professor <a href=""/sachsp"">Paul J. Sachs</a> at Harvard to convince their press to published them. But Harvard University Press turned him down. Rewald, again at Barr's insistence, tried and failed to obtain a Guggenheim fellowship. Ultimately, Barr persuaded the New York branch of the Durand-Ruel Gallery to make a tax-free contribution to the Museum, which Barr gave to Rewald to complete the <u>History of Impressionism</u>. <u>The History of Impressionism</u> was published to universal acclaim in 1946. Rewald spent the rest of his life in part revising and republishing it in five editions. After a divorce from his first wife, he married Alice Bellony [formerly Alice Leglise] in 1956. Rewald was a visiting professor at Princeton University between 1961 and 1964. He joined the art faculty of the University of Chicago in 1964, remaining until 1971. During that time he wrote the Abrams (publisher) volume on Paul Gauguin for their <u>Library of Great Painters</u> series. In 1971 he became part of the Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York as distinguished professor of art history. In 1977 he organized the highly important CĚ©zanne: The Late Work exhibition at MoMA with <a href=""/rubinw"">William Rubin</a>. He spent the year 1979 as the A. W. Mellon Lecturer, National Gallery of Art. Rewald retired from CUNY in 1984. In 1986 he was awarded the Mitchell Prize for his dissertation on CĚ©zanne and Zola, which appeared in English as <u>Cezanne: A Biography</u>. Rewald was instrumental in creating a foundation to buy CĚ©zanne's studio and turn it into a museum. He died of congrestive heart failure at age 81. His <em>catalogue raisonnĚ©</em> of CĚ©zanne was completed and appeared after his death in 1996. A street in Aix-en-Provence, where CĚ©zanne lived and worked, is named after him. His son, Paul Rewald, who was a vice president of Sotheby Parke Bernet, died of cancer at age 32 in 1976. His daughter-in-law, Sabine Rewald, is a curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Rewald's scholarship, most exemplified in his histories of Impressionism and Post-Impressionism, is the highly documentary, nearly day-by-day account of the movement. The thick text provides wonderful documentation of the movement but, compared to other treatments of the subjects, are shorter on analysis. They remain the authority for dates and chronology of late-nineteenth century French art. A connoisseur historian at odds with heavy psychological interpretations, he was a vocal critic, along with the critic <a href=""/canadayj"">John Canady</a> of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's selling of some of its important paintings in the early 1970s under Director <a href=""/hovingt"">Thomas Hoving</a>.  Throughout his career, he advised the wealthy art collectors John Hay Whitney and Paul Mellon on purchases both to their private collections and donations to art galleries.

1842,"Roh, Franz",21 February 1890,"Apolda, Thuringia, Germany",30-Dec-65,"Munich, Germany","Modernist art historian and critic, coiner of the term ""magic realism."" Roh studied philosophy, literature, history and art history at the universities in Leipzig, Berlin under <a href=""/goldschmidta"">Adolph Goldschmidt</a>, and in Basel. Between 1916-1919 he worked as the assistant to <a href=""/wolfflinh"">Heinrich WĚ¦lfflin</a> in Munich in his famous Kunsthistorischen Seminars. He received his Ph.D. from Munich in 1920, writing his dissertation, <u>HollĚ_ndische Malerei des 17. Jahrhunderts</u> under WĚ¦lfflin. He worked as a freelance critic and writer, and as an artist creating surrealist photo-collages. He also wrote art criticism for various newspapers and journals including <u>Cicerone</u>, <u>Kunstblatt</u>, <u>Werk</u>, and <u>Die Kunst</u>. This brought him into contact with many of the important artists of his generation, including George Grosz, Kurt Schwitters, Willi Baumeister and Max Ernst. In 1925 he published the first of two early important works on modernist art history, <u>Nach-Expressionismus - magischer Realismus: Probleme der neuesten europĚ_isches Malerei</u>. The work was translated into Spanish in 1927 by the important esthetician Ortega y Gasset (1883-1955) in his influential <u>Revista de Occidente</u> in Madrid. In 1929 his <u>Foto-auge - 76 Fotos der Zeit</u>, appeared with the artist Jan Tschichold. His positive stance on modern art put him at odds with the Nazi government at their assumption of power in 1933. He was forbidden to write and was briefly jailed. Roh spent the years of World War II in isolation working on a book about the phenomenon of misunderstanding artists. After the war in 1946 he married the art historian Juliane Bartsch (b. 1909), his second wife. His book appeared in 1948 as <u>Das Verkannte KĚ_nstler: Geschichte und Theorie des kulturellen MiĚŮverstehen</u>. That same year he began teaching art history at the newly reorganized University of Munich, a position he held until his death. Roh continued to write art criticism and in 1951 he became the first president of the German branch of the International Association of Art Critics. He championed contemporary art at a time in the post-war years when other art historians were decrying contemporary art. He took on Vienna-school art historian (and his future Munich colleague) <a href=""/sedlmayrh"">Hans Sedlmayr</a>, in 1950 in the celebrated debate of post-war intellectuals known as the ""DarmstĚ_dter GesprĚ_ch."" Sedlmayr's 1948 book <u>Verlust der Mitte</u> had attacked modern art as ""centerless,"" i.e., unfocused and degenerate. Roh's 1962 book, <u>Der Streit um die moderne Kunst</u>, reviewed many of the debates concerning the public acceptance of modern art, focusing particularly Sedlmayr.  Athough an important historian of art, Roh's claim to fame lies in his naming an artistic mode that returned to verisimilitude after the era of expressionism, ""Magic Realism"". Roh saw this tendency as post-Expressionism, a return to figural representation and yet a departure from realism (de Chirico, Picasso, Grosz). Although the movement in art that Roh wrote about was eclipsed by Neue Sachlichkeit and Surrealism, the concept took hold in literature and film, an appellation for some of the most important creations of the twentieth century in those genres.",Germany,"Wendland, Ulrike. <u>Biographisches Handbuch deutschsprachiger Kunsthistoriker im Exil: Leben und Werk der unter dem Nationalsozialismus verfolgten und vertriebenen Wissenschaftler</u>.

Her 1930 dissertation was accepted from the university in Hamburg on the topic of Cologne cathedral. She moved to the University in MĚ_nster with plans to write her Habilitation under <a href=""/wackernagelm"">Martin Wackernagel</a>. Rosenau worked on excavations in the cathedrals in Bremen, Cologne and the GroĚŮmĚ_nster church in ZĚ_rich. The new Nazi government forbade Jews, she and her mother emigrated first to Switzerland and then to the United Kingdom in 1933. She succeeded in writing her habilitation, <u>Desing and Medieval Architecture</u>, using a 1934-1935 stipend from the British Federation of University Women. Rosenau continued study at the Courtauld Institute between 1935 and 1940, researching the architectural history of the synagogue. She married Zwi Carmi (1883-1900), a medical doctor in 1938. A Ph.D. degree was granted by the Courtauld, University of London, in 1940. Rosenau worked at the London School of Economics in 1941 for the socialogist Karl Mannheim (1893-1947), researching the social place of women in the mirror of art.

1856,"Rosenberg, Jakob",1893,"Berlin, Germany",1980,"Cambridge, MA, USA","Rembrandt and drawing scholar; Harvard University professor 1948-1964. Rosenberg came from a family of art dealers, his brother, Saemy Rosenberg (1893-1971) eventually establishing the New York firm of Rosenberg & Stiebel. His parents were Gabriel Rosenberg and Bertha Rosenbaum (Rosenberg). Early in his life, Rosenberg planned to entry his family's antique business. However, when World War I was declared, he joined the German army cavalry and during a campaign in France, was wounded, captured and sent to a POW camp in Scotland. In a prisoner exchange, Rosenberg was sent to Switzerland where he was allowed to study art history initially at Bern and later ZĚ_rich. After the war he apprenticed with an art dealer, however, his temperament, by his own admission was more toward scholarship than trade. He entered the university in Munich where Heinrich WĚ¦lfflin (q.v.) was the <i> ordinarius</i> professor of art history. He received his Ph. D. <i>summa cum laude</i> under WĚ¦lfflin in 1922 (published 1923) writing on the drawings of Martin Schongauer. The same year he married Elisabeth Husserl, daughter of the philosopher Edmund Husserl. He was hired for the Print Room of the Berlin museum, under Max J. FriedlĚ_nder (q.v.) and its Director General, Wilhelm von Bode (q.v.). Although he had little personal contact with Bode, FriedlĚ_nder became his other great mentor, instilling in him a love of drawings and connoisseurship. In 1928, his monograph of Jacob Ruisdael's paintings and drawings appeared. He succeeded FriedlĚ_nder as head of the Print collection in 1930 (FriedlĚ_nder was now director of the Berlin Museum). Among his notable successes was diverting the selections requested by Nazi <i> Reichsmarshall</i> Hermann Goering--who was ""borrowing"" works of art for his own collection--from the precious German renaissance examples to less valuable erotic scenes. Rosenberg and FriedlĚ_nder collaborated on a monograph on Lucas Cranach in 1932. His war service allowed him to remain at the Museum even after the Nazi government began purging Jews from institutions. In 1935, however, Rosenberg resigned from the Print Collection, and at the suggestion of Adolf Goldschmidt (q.v.), he was issued an invitation to Harvard for the summer 1936 art history seminar, though Rosenberg had done no lecturing. His success at this, and friendship with Fogg Museum director Paul J. Sachs (q.v.) led to first a standing invitation and finally an appointment at Harvard in 1937. In 1939 he was made curator of Prints at the Fogg. Rosenberg acquired important works on paper for the museum, including German Expressionist examples, discarded by museums under National Socialist as ""degenerate."" He was appointed an associate professor in the Department of Fine Arts in 1940 and professor in 1948, the same year as his major monograph on Rembrandt. His book <u>Great Draughtsmen from Pisanello to Picasso</u>, published in 1959, was a deeply personal view of his specialty area of drawings. In 1969 when the Rembrandt Research Project, a committee of art historians gathered to reduce the number of authentic Rembrandts, announced its plans, Rosenberg became a vocal critic. He retired <i>emeritus</i> from Harvard in 1964. In 1966 he and fellow Harvard art historian Seymour Slive (q.v.) authored the volume <u>Dutch Art and Architecture</u> for the important <u>Pelican History of Art</u> series. The following year, he published his A. W. Mellon Lectures, <u> Quality in Art</u>, as much a historiography of connoisseurship as a guide to his own beliefs. Shortly before his death, a revised version of his Rembrandt book was chosen for publication as part of Cornell University's <u> Landmarks in Art History</u> series. Rosenberg remained committed throughout his career to the formalistic methodology of his mentor, WĚ¦lfflin, preferring stylistic rather than the literary approach to art history. In later years he repudiated some of WĚ¦lfflin's oversimplifications (Slive). Rosenberg's brand of connoisseurship, like FriedlĚ_nder's, relied on intuition and vast experience rather than cataloging of stylistic idiosyncrasies of an individual artist that Giovanni Morelli (q.v.) employed. He doubted the ultimate usefulness of ""committee judgments"" for authenticity (for example, the Rembrandt Research Project), preferring the value of the expert individual.

1906,"Saxl, Fritz",08 January 1890,"Vienna, Austria",22-Mar-48,"Dulwich, UK","Courtauld Institute professor and librarian, instrumental force in moving Warburg library to London and administering it duirng Warburg's mental illness. Saxl was born to Ignaz Saxl and Wilhelmine Falk (Saxl). His father was a distinguished state attorney in Vienna. Although of devout Jewish grandparentage, Saxl's father had rejected religion and the children were raised in a secular, culturally-Jewish home. After receiving an <i>Abitur</i> from the Maximilians gymnasium in 1908, where his classmate was the future art historian <a href=""/kaufmanne"">Emil Kaufmann</a>, Saxl studied art history and archaeology in Vienna at the Institut fĚ_r ĚĐsterreichische Geschichtsforschung under the [second] ""Vienna School"" art historians <a href=""/wickhofff"">Franz Wickhoff</a>, <a href=""/schlosserj"">Julius von Schlosser</a> and <a href=""/dvorakm"">Max Dvo�ŞĚÁk</a> and in Berlin, 1909-1910 under <a href=""/wolfflinh"">Heinrich WĚ¦lfflin</a>. Saxl completed his dissertation still only age 22, under Dvo�ŞĚÁk on various aspects of Rembrandt in 1912. The year before he had met the private scholar-art historian <a href=""/warburga"">Abraham ""Aby"" Warburg</a>. Saxl spent the academic year 1912-1913 on a stipend in Rome where he studied medieval texts on astrology and mythology. In 1913 he married Elise Bienenfeld and joined the Warburg Library in Hamburg as the librarian. Saxl fell under Warburg's spell, adopting his mentor's methodology, viewing the history of art as the transmission of pagan myth through literature and art of the medieval and renaissance periods. Although Saxl had specialized in the baroque era in Vienna, his interest in the medieval period and astrological manuscripts, alive before he met Warburg, took on new meaning. The first volume of a catalog of astrological manuscripts appeared in 1915. When World War I erupted, Saxl served as a first lieutenant in the Austro-Hungarian army (1914-1918) seeing action in Italy and 1918-19 as a teacher for the army. In 1919 he returned to the Warburg. Warburg himself was indefinitely committed to a mental asylum and Saxl took over the day-to-day running of the library foundation, and developing it, with colleague <a href=""/bingg"">Gertrud Bing</a>, from 1922 onward, according to Warburg's wishes into the Warburg Institut, aligning it with the newly founded University of Hamburg in 1921. Saxl enlisted Warburg's brothers, financiers in New York and Hamburg, to assist financially. Saxl initiated the <u>VortrĚ_ge der Bibliothek Warburg</u>, publishing an article himself in the series. Saxl was a <i> privatdozent</i> (1922-1923) and then lecturer between 1923-1933 for the University in Hamburg. In 1923 Saxl and another Warburg exponent, <a href=""/panofskye"">Erwin Panofsky</a>, jointly authored an important study building on Warburg's principle of pictorial themes migrating to intellectual realm, using DĚ_rer's <u> Melancholia I</u>. Warburg returned from hospitalization in 1924. Saxl traveled on research outings to Rome, London, Vienna and Heidelberg. A second volume of the astrological manuscripts appeared in 1927. At Warburg's death in 1929, Saxl succeeded him as director. Saxl foresaw the disasters the Nazis promised for scholarship in Germany, especially for those institutions intimately connected with Jewish founders and scholars such as Saxl and Warburg. He gave fellow Schlosser student <a href=""/kurzo"">Otto Kurz</a> a position as librarian when Kurz could find no work in anti-semitic Austria. Saxl himself hoped to move the Warburg to Holland, but when those deliberations failed, Saxl contracted with Samuel Courtauld (1876-1947, principal benefactor of the Courtauld Institute) and Arthur Hamilton Lee (Viscount Lee of Fareham, 1868-1947, Chairman, Management Committee of the Courtauld Institute of Art) to move the Warburg Library ""on loan"" to the Courtauld Institute at the University of London in 1933. At the same time, other Hamburg scholars who were connected with the Warburg followed. These included the recently graduated <a href=""/buchthalh"">Hugo Buchthal</a>, <a href=""/winde"">Edgar Wind</a> and <a href=""/gombriche"">Ernst Gombrich</a>. The library was temporary housed in the basement of Thames House. In 1938 the Warburg lost this temporary housing and the papers had once again to be crated up. Funds to maintain this unusual think-tank were particularly hard to come by. Saxl devoted the remaining years of his life to maintaining the Institute, at the cost of his own scholarship. When Britain entered the World War II, the Warburg was evacuated to Denham, England, and Saxl hired Buchthal to be its librarian for most of the 1940s and as a scholar to keep it responsive to the needs of research. Saxl became a British citizen in 1940. In 1944 the Warburg Institute was officially made part of the University of London. Between 1945 and 1946, he traveled to the United States, securing cooperation on a number of scholarly projects, among them the Illustrated Bartsch, (the <u> Peintre graveur</u> of <a href=""/bartscha"">Adam von Bartsch</a>, updated scholarship and illustrations), and a Census of Classical Works of Art Known to the Renaissance, sparked by the enthusiasm of <a href=""/lehmannk"">Karl Lehmann</a>, <a href=""/krautheimerr"">Richard Krautheimer</a> and Panofsky. Saxl spent the final years of his life maintaining the Warburg. It was often noted by biographers that he sacrificed personal scholarship in order to run the Warburg. At his death in 1948, he was succeeded by <a href=""/frankforth"">Henri Frankfort</a>. The remaining volumes of the <u> Verzeichnis astrologischer und mythologischer illustrierter Handschriften</u>, renamed the <u>Catalogue of Astrological and Mythological Illuminated Manuscripts of the Latin Middle Ages</u>, were issued in 1953 by <a href=""/meierh"">Hans Meier</a> and <a href=""/boberh"">Harry Bober</a>. Bing was his life partner and the two maintained a house in Dulwich, England, where they entertained. Saxl represents in some ways the ""purest"" continuation of Aby Warburg's methodology. Other Warburg scholars (Wind, Gombrich, Panofsky) developed their own stamp. But Saxl remained fascinated by the transmission of mythology through the language of forms on which Warburg had founded his institution. His methodological influence was particularly profound on <a href=""/adhemarj"">Jean AdhĚ©mar</a>.",Austria;UK,"Bing, Gertrud.

1910,"Schapire, Rosa",1874,"Brody, Galacia, Poland; [present day Ukraine]",1954,"London, England, UK","Early champion of Germany Expressionism and author of the first graphics catalog of Schmidt-Rottluff. Born to wealthy Jewish parents in Jewish community of Brody, Schapire was privately tutored along with her sisters. In 1893 she moved to Hamburg, writing feminist essays, including ""Ein Wort zur Frauenemanzipation"" (A word on women's emancipation) in 1897. Inspired by the art lectures of the museum directors <a href=""/brinckmannj"">Justus Brinckmann</a> at the Museum fĚ_r Kunst und Gewerbe and <a href=""/lichtwarka"">Alfred Lichtwark</a> at the Kunsthalle, she studied art history at the University in Bern, showing an early interest in modern art by writing an essay on the controversial Swiss painter Ferdinand Hodler.graduating in 1902. She graduated the same year, continuing graduate work in art history at Heidelberg, where her fellow students included <a href=""/redslobe"">Erwin Redslob</a>, <a href=""/kaesbachw"">Walter Kaesbach</a>, <a href=""/waldmanne"">Emil Waldmann</a>, and <a href=""/kuhnele"">Ernst KĚ_hnel</a>. In 1904 she received her Ph.D. writing dissertation under <a href=""/thodeh"">Henry Thode</a> on the Frankfurt painter Johann Ludwig Ernst Morgenstern. Schapire continued a post-doctorate semester with <a href=""/wolfflinh"">Heinrich WĚ¦lfflin</a> in Berlin and the year 1905 at Leipzig University. After several years of more travel, she returned to Hamburg in 1908, translating and writing criticism. Among those whose works she translated into German were Balzac and the Polish art historian <a href=""/chledowskik"">Kazimierz Chledowski</a>. She met the judge and art historian <a href=""/schieflerg"">Gustav Schiefler</a> and around 1906. The two became supporters of the Dresden German Expressionist movement <em>Die BrĚ_cke</em> joining the <em>BrĚ_cke</em> as sustaining members (""passive members""). All the <em>BrĚ_cke</em> artists created and sent her ""art postcards"" for her support. Though initially close to the <em>BrĚ_cke</em> artist Emile Nolde and his wife, they fell out and Schapire became friends and a supporter of Karl Schmidt-Rottluff. In 1911, Schapire mounted the first solo exhibition of Schmidt-Rottluff in Hamburg. During World War I she and the feminist Ida Dehmel (1870-1942) founded the Frauenbund zur FĚ¦rderung deutscher bildenden Kunst (Women's Society for the Advancement of German Art) in 1916. The organization made gifts of women's art to state museums. After the war Schapire co-edited and contributed to two Weimar-era Expressionist journals, <u>Die Rote Erde</u> (The Red Earth) and <u>KĚ_ndung</u> (Herald), entering the circle of the Hamburg Secessionists. Schmidt-Rottluff moved to Hamburg and created furniture, clothing and other objects into a <em>Gesamtkunstwerk</em> for Schapire in her apartment in 1921. She also collected heavily from the artist's works, wrting the graphics <em>catalogue raisonnĚ©</em> of Schmidt-Rottluff in 1924. Her Jewish heritage and support of modernist art made her a target of the Nazi's, who rose to power in 1933. After the 1937 degenerate art exhibition in Munich, Schapire was placed under house arrest in her Hamburg apartment. She published under a pseudonym. In 1939, fellow Hamburg art historian <a href=""/saxlf"">Fritz Saxl</a> now Director of the Warburg Institute in its new home in London, sponsored Schapire's immigration ot England. She left only two weeks before the start of World War II. The Gestapo confiscated and auctioned her library and abandoned works of art in 1940 and her furniture burned in an air raid on Hamburg in 1943. After the war, she worked for the architectural historian <a href=""/pevsnern"">Nikolaus Pevsner</a>, collecting material for his project <u>The Buildings of England</u>. She contributed articles to various art periodicals, including <u>Architectural Review</u>, <u>Eidos</u>, <u>Connoisseur</u> and <u>Die Weltkunst</u>. Her offers to house her collection of Expressionist art in British public collections were thwarted. In 1946 she offered to donate a portion of her Expressionist collection to theTate Gallery was received cooly by the conservative director <a href=""/rothensteinj"">John Rothenstein</a>; the gift was not realized and then only partially so until after her death. Likewise, an offer of her complete collection of graphics and works on paper was rejected by the British Museum Department of Prints and Drawings in 1950. Schapire died in the Tate Museum near the portrait Schmidt-Rottluff painted of her in 1954. The largest part of her collection, including 600 graphic works, was bequeathed German museums in Mannheim, Berlin, (Hamburg-) Altona, Hamburg and Cologne. Numerous portraits of her by Schmidt-Rottluff exist. Her younger sister, Anna Schapire (1877-1911) married the economist and social scientist Otto Neurath (1882-1945). Schapire was one of the early women to graduate with a degree in art history from a German university. Her tireless crusades for art and equality brought her causes to Hamburg, helping the emerging industrial city forge a modernist identity.

Schwarz graduated from the Akademisches Gymnasium in Vienna with an Abitur in 1913. He entered the university in Vienna studying art history, archaeology and philosophy. At the outbreak of World War I, Schwarz served in the Austrian miliary, 1914, assigned to the field artillery. He resumed his studies in 1919, writing a disseration on the beginning of lithography in Vienna, under the ""Vienna School"" scholar <a href=""/dvorakm"">Max Dvo�ŞĚÁk</a>, though his degree came after Dvo�ŞĚÁk's death in 1921. He worked as a volunteer at the Albertina Musum print collection, 1921-1923. Still unsalaried, he was promoted to a scholar research assistant from 1923 to 1927. That yeat, 1927 he accepted a position as curator at the Austrian Gallery, ""Baroque Museum"" (Belvedere) in the 19th-century gallery under F. M. Haberditzl. Schwarz was responsible for many exhibitions on 19th-century art at the museum, which opened in 1929, foreign exhibitions, as well as the 1934 Venice Biennale. Though Schwarz' field of study was graphics in general, his early interest in photography as an art medium made him a pioneer in the field. He was the first to write (in 1931) on the photographer David Octavius Hill. The annexation of Austria by the Nazis in 1938 meant that Schwarz, a Roman Catholic of Jewish decent, could no longer work in national museums. Schwarz sold part of his personal library to move to Sweden the same year. He immigrated to the United States in 1940 working as a research assistant at the Albright Knox Museum in Buffalo, NY. Schwarz received financial living assistance from <a href=""/warburge"">Edward M. ""Eddie"" Warburg</a>, an arts benefactor, amateur art historians and nephew of art historian <a href=""/warburga"">Aby Warburg</a>. In 1943 he was appointed curator for painting, drawing and prints at the Museum of Art, Rhode Island School of Design. He married in 1948, remaining at RISD until 1953. After two years as a visiting professor, 1954-1956, at Wesleyan University, Middletown, CT, he taught as professor there 1956-1962 and as the curator of the Davidson Art Center Collection (the latter through 1972). Schwarz lectured at visiting professor at Columbia University between 1966 and 1968 as a replacement for <a href=""/heldj"">Julius Held</a>. He retired emeritus in 1972. ""Schwarz was a pioneer of the study of photography's historical evolution and development and its relationship with the traditional pictorial arts. He proposed that photography benefited from the 'inner-preparedness' it had been given by the fact that the 'fixed viewpoint had become the <em>alpha</em> and <em>omega</em> of the aesthetic credo.""

2014,"Simson, Otto von",1912,"Berlin, Germany",1993,"Berlin, Germany","Scholar of medieval and renaissance architectural and art history; professor at the University of Chicago 1945-1957. Simson was the son of Ernst Eduard von Simson, and undersecretary of state in the German foreign office, and Martha Enole (von Simson), a descendent of the philosopher Moses Mendelssohn (1729-1786). His great grandfather had originally been Jewish but converted to Roman Catholicism. Simson himself grew up in the cultured home of his grandfather, the chemist Franz Oppenheim (1852-1929) in the ""Villa Oppenheim."" Their neighbor was the director of the Hamburg Kunsthalle <a href=""/lichtwarka"">Alfred Lichtwark</a>, who inhabited the villa formerly owned by Max Liebermann. The young Simson grew up among the masterworks of German Impressionism. His family was highly distinguished in German politics and statecraft, his father served as a state administrator. Simson attended the Arndtgymnasium in Berlin Dahlem Dorf. After graduation (age 17) he was sent to England to learn English. After returning, he entered the university in Freiburg studying art history under under <a href=""/jantzenh"">Hans Jantzen</a>, <a href=""/friedlanderw"">Walter FriedlĚ_nder</a>, and <a href=""/bauchk"">Kurt Bauch</a>. He studied briefly in Berlin before focusing moving to Munich in 1932 to study under <a href=""/pinderw"">Wilhelm Pinder</a>. Most of Simson's work, however was under <a href=""/eversh"">Hans Eberhard Evers</a>. Simson completed a dissertation on Rubens, and published as <u>Zur Genealogie der weltlichen Apotheose im Barock, besonders der Medicigalerie des Peter Paul Rubens</u>, in 1936. He married the princess Aloysia (Louise) Alexandra von SchĚ¦nburg Hartenstein (1906-1976) the same year. Simson worked initially at the Courtauld Institute Library in 1936 and as an editor for the periodical <u>Hochland</u> in Munich. He converted to Roman Catholicism in 1937. With Germany's seizure of Czech lands, the so-called Czech Crisis, Simson was drafted into the German army. Shortly before the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Simson used his military <i>Wehrpass</i> (military pass) to visit American museums on the excuse of his being an art historian; he remained in the U.S. with his wife and children following. He taught briefly at Marymount College in Tarrytown, New York (1939-43) (an offer to teach at Johns Hopkins came too late) and St. Mary's College in Notre Dame, Indiana. In 1945 University of Chicago president Robert Maynard Hutchins (1899-1977) offered Simson a job in the University's Committee on Social Thought and only secondarily in the Department of Art. He rose to full professor in 1951. During this period he produced two major books characteristic of his methodology. The first, <u>The Sacred Fortress</u> (he despised the title; it was suggested by his editor) appeared in 1948. He was also a guest resident at the University of Frankfurt in the years immediately after the war. Simson's <u>The Gothic Cathedral</u> appeared in 1956 and with it a rave review in the <u>Times Literary Supplement</u>, but a caustic review by <a href=""/crosbys"">Sumner Crosby</a> in the <u>Art Bulletin</u>. The heated exchange broke a long-standing friendship between the two. Simson returned to Germany in 1957, taking a position first at the university Frankfurt, and then as the first German member of UNESCO. In 1964 he became Director of the Kunsthistorisches Institut of the Freie UniversitĚ_t in Berlin (succeeding literary historian Hans Kaufmann, 1926-2000) and professor of modern art. At the Freie UniversitĚ_t he was instrumental in sponsoring several conferences on Dutch art, such as the 1970 one on Rembrandt and the 1975 one on Brueghel. In 1972 he edited and wrote the revision to the prestigious <u>PropylĚ_en Kunstgeschichte</u> volume on the middle ages, <u>Das Mittelalter II: das Hohe Mittelalter</u>, along with <a href=""/fillitzh"">Hermann Fillitz</a> and others. After the death of his first wife in 1976, he married another woman of noble lineage, Marie-Anne zu Salm-Reifferscheidt-Krautheim und Dyck (b. 1933) in 1978. He remained at the Freie UniversitĚ_t until 1979. In 1986 his book, <u>Der Blick nach Innen</u>, the result of lectures he presented at Harvard on nineteenth-century German art, Simson put forth the concept of ""Innerlichkeit"" as characteristic in the work of four German painters, Caspar David Friedrich, Carl Spitzweg, Wilhelm Leibl and Ludwig Richter. The posthumous <u>Peter Paul Rubens (1577 1640) Humanist, Maler, Diplomat</u> (1996) brought together Simson's work on the artist with whom he had been preoccupied, though little published, for much of his career. Simson's methodology was in large part to lay an intellectual <em>Geistesgeschichte</em> framework over his studies of medieval architecture. His book <u>The Sacred Fortress</u> deals with the mosaics of Ravenna in terms of the liturgy which would have been used at the time. Because of the war, Simson never had a chance to examine the mosaics during the time he wrote the book. His <u>Gothic Cathedral</u> put him in the middle of a wider, 20th-century dialogue on Gothic architecture with <a href=""/sedlmayrh"">Hans Sedlmayr</a>, <a href=""/panofskye"">Erwin Panofsky</a> and Crosby. He and Sedlmayr wrote of the Gothic church as a mystical <em>Gesamtkunstwerk</em>, a totality of all artistic media, whose meaning had to be derived from experiencing the building as a whole, as opposed to scholars who sought to dissect a building to interpret its iconographic parts (Crossley). Simson's erudite study of Abbot Suger's choir in the <u>Gothic Cathedral</u> postulated the formation of the Gothic as a combination of ""Pseudo-Dionysian light metaphysics"" and the harmonic ratios of musical cosmology. This interpretation was challenged by <a href=""/gosebruchm"">Martin Gosebruch</a> and denied by <a href=""/kidsonp"">Peter Kidson</a> as over-intellectualizing. Simson's published dissertation on the secular apotheosis in Baroque art found praise early from Panofsky. Simson conceived his PropylĚ_en series <u>Das Mittelalter II: das Hohe Mittelalter</u> as an extension of his <u>Gothic Cathedral</u>, but greatly internationalized, with Polish scholars writing the sections on the art in Poland formerly under German rule. He was known as an engaging lecturer and warm to his many students.",Germany;USA,"Kleinbauer, W. Eugene. <u>Research Guide to the History of Western Art</u>.

2058,"Stechow, Wolfgang",1896,"Kiel, Schleswig Holstein, Germany",1974,"Princeton, NJ, USA","Scholar of the Dutch baroque, especially graphics and Ruysdael; Oberlin University professor1940-63. Stechow's father, Waldemar Stechow, was an attorney and his mother, Bertha Deutschmann, a concert singer. As a young man, Stechow was educated at the Gymnasium in GĚ¦ttingen and, after graduating in 1913, volunteered for the German Army at the outbreak of World War I the following year. In 1915 he was taken prisoner of war by the Russians and spent the next two years in a Siberian camp. He returned to GĚ¦ttingen where he wrote his dissertation at Georgia Augusta University under <a href=""/vitzthumg"">Count Georg Vizthum</a> on the subject of DĚ_rer's Apocalypse. He served as an assistant keeper of the Kaiser Friedrich Museum, Berlin, under <a href=""/bodew"">Wihlem von Bode</a> 1921-1922, before he returning to GĚ¦ttingen (1923-1935). There he taught courses as a <em>privatdozent</em> with <a href=""/pevsnern"">Nikolaus Pevsner</a>. There, too, he collaborated as part of the group of German scholars <a href=""/hofstededegrootc"">Hofstede de Groot</a> assembled for his new volumes of the <em>catalogue raisonnĚ©</em> of Dutch Painting (1923, 1926). Stechow wrote his <em>Habilitationsschrift</em> in 1926 on Dutch mannerism, also under Vizthum. A talented violinist and keyboardist, Stechow performed and organized musical concerts in GĚ¦ttingen between 1923-1936. During the same time, he contributed many entries for the 37-volume ""Thieme-Becker"" <u>Allgemeines Lexikon der bildenden KĚ_nstler</u> on Dutch artists. He was appointed Extraordinarius professor at GĚ¦ttingen in 1931. A protestant of Jewish decent, he lost his academic position at the hands of the Nazi government in 1936. Vizthum sheltered him long enough for Stechow to publish his Salomon Ruysdael book and catalog in 1938. Stechow emigrated to the United States in the same year, were art historian <a href=""/hageno"">Oskar Hagen</a>, a friend from GĚ¦ttingen days, secured him a position as Assistant Professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, where Hagen also taught. Stechow left Madison for Oberlin College in 1940, a position he held until his emeritus designation in 1963. Stechow was a renowned teacher who made the deliberate choice to devote his energies to pedagogy rather than book publication. Although his articles number over 200, he produced comparatively few monographs. His best known work, <u>Dutch Landscape Painting of the Seventeenth Century</u> (1966) was written after his retirement. In 1964 he began as advisory curator at the Cleveland Museum of Art, where he was instrumental in acquiring outstanding Dutch paintings. Stechow lectured and taught extensively during his life. It was while at Princeton teaching a class in retirement, that he died. A second edition of the Ruysdael catalog appeared after his death. Stechow's training was strong in connoisseurship, to which he added the study of iconography. Although excellent in what he did, his methodology attracted criticism. <a href=""/steinbergl"">Leo Steinberg</a> criticized Stechow in a book review which Stechow took personally, causing a noted enmity between the two the remainder of their careers. Stechow is most closely associated with authenticity of paintings using connoisseurship (Rysdael). His other major monograph, <u>Dutch Landscape Painting</u>, shows him avoiding the common practice of historic periodization in favor of thematic groupings. The chair of Oberlin during the 1950s, <a href=""/parkhurstc"">Charles Parkhurst</a>, recalled Stechow's affinities for puns and great wit; Stechow, he said, referred to the introductory course in art history as ""From mud to Klee.""

2103,"Swarzenski, Georg",1876,"Dresden, Germany",1957,"Brookline, MA, USA","Medievalist and modernist; Director of Frankfurt art museums and later a Museum of Fine Art, Boston acquisitions curator, 1939-1957. Swarzenski's father was Adolf Hanns Swarzenski, a prosperous Dresden merchant originally of Jewish origin, and his mother, Auguste Beck (Swarzenski). In 1896 graduated with a degree in law from Heidelberg. He married Ella Perec-Wilcynska, [name sometimes appearing as Pertz-Wilcynska] in 1899, turning his attention to art history. Swarzenski studied art under the great medievalist Adolph Goldschmidt (q.v.) in Berlin and in Heidelberg under Henry Thode (q.v.), gaining his second degree in 1901. His dissertation was on the Regensburg school of manuscript illumination of the tenth and eleventh centuries. He initially worked as an assistant at the research assistant at the Berlin Museums where he likely habilitated in 1903, when he was designation a privatdozent. After a year as an assistant at the Kunsthistorischen Institut in Florence, he returned to Berlin as an assistant for the Kunstgewerbemuseum (""useful arts"" museum). In 1906 he was appointed director of the StĚ_delsches Kunstinstitut in Frankfurt, a privately endowed and operated art museum, which Thode had at one time directed. Seeing the need to acquire more art than the StĚ_delsches could afford, Swarzenski convinced the city of Frankfurt to found its own, publicly funded art museum, the StĚ_dtische Galerie, (municipal gallery) to buy works, under Swarzenski's direction, to complement the StĚ_delsches holdings. The StĚ_dtische collection grew to include works by the Impressionists (Monet) and Post-Impressionists (CĚ©zanne and van Gogh) and later by Picasso, Munch, Ensor and Die BrĚ_cke artists and others of German Expressionism, some of whom taught at the Kunstinstitut. He hired the fledgling art historian Fritz Wichert (q.v.) to assist him. In 1909 Swarzenski opened a combined museum, though still distinct in terms of collections, which he jointly directed with the Liebieghaus sculpture museum. He married a second time in 1916, to Marie MĚ¦ssinger. The following year, he contributed essays on modern art for the important survey, <u>Handbuch der Kunstwissenschaft</u>. Together with his assistant, the art historian Alfred Wolters (q.v.), he founded the <u>StĚ_del Jahrbuch</u> beginning in 1921 (which they co-edited through 1936). About this time, he began a liaison with Calola Netter, whom he installed in the museum as his intern. A double portrait of his wife and mistress was painted by Max Beckmann in 1923. Swarzenski was gifted museum innovator. He organized period rooms for decorative arts in his museums. Between 1925-1931 he held musical concerts in the rooms, one of the first directors to do so. His knowledge of the art market brought many masterworks to his museums. He was also of sufficient means that he could afford to donate pictures to the museum personally; the famous van Gogh portrait of Dr. Gachet was one of these. Swarzenski wrote columns in the local newspaper, the <u>Frankfurter Zeitung</u>, communicating his interests and the museums' needs to the German and greater European public. In 1928 Swarzenski was appointed Director-General of all Frankfurt museums. He used his new position to purchase a significant part of the large Sigmaringen collection. The museum's Kunstgewerbemuseum, also rose to prominence under Swarzenski's direction. As a director somewhat ahead of his time, he mounted an early ""blockbuster"" show, a display of goldsmithing work, known as the Welfenschatz, which attracted huge crowds from the region. The rise of the Nazis to power in 1933 put Swarzenski into direct conflict with their ideas of art. Forced to remove many works of modernist art from the museums walls because of their ""degenerate"" designation by the Nazis--and distrusted for his Jewish background--Swarzenski ultimately resigned in 1938 and fled to United States. Many of the modernist works he acquired, including his personal donation of the Dr. Gachet, were deaccessioned and sold. In the United States, he lectured at Institute for Advance Studies, Princeton, NJ, for the 1938-1939 year before Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Director G. H. Edgell (q.v.) offered him a position to build the medieval area of the collection. His 1940 Boston exhibition, ""Arts of the Middle Ages: 1000-1400,"" marked Boston as a center of interest in the middle ages. He retired in 1956 and was succeeded by his son, Hanns Swarzenski (q.v.) who also distinguished himself at Boston as an art historian.",Germany;USA,"Kleinbauer, W.

2104,"Swarzenski, Hanns",1903,"Charlottenburg, Berlin, Germany",1985,"Wilzhofen, Bavaria, Germany","Medievalist; Curator of Decorative Arts and Sculpture at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston,1956-1973. Swarzenski grew up in Frankfurt, Germany, where his father, Georg Swarzenski (q.v.) was the director of the StĚ_delsches Kunstinstitut (museum) and the Liebieghaus sculpture museum. His mother was Ella Perec-Wilcynska, [name sometimes appearing as Pertz-Wilcynska]. As a young man he met the German Expressionist artist Max Beckmann who taught at the StĚ_delsches school. He studied art history at Freiburg under Walter Friedlaender (q.v.), in Berlin, under Adolph Goldschmidt (q.v.), under whom his father had also studied, and from whom he likely honed his connoisseurship skills. While pursuing his dissertation, he participated in the <em>Jahrtausundaustellung</em> (millenial celebration) in DĚ_sseldorf in 1925 under Fritz Witte (q.v.). The exhibition gave him early and unusual experience with manuscripts and medieval art. He received his Ph.D. from the University in Bonn in 1927 with a dissertation on medieval German book illumination under Paul Clemen (q.v.). He became a fellow of the Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florence. He was awarded a travel grant to study as a Fellow at the Fogg Museum, Harvard University in 1928. He returned to Berlin and worked at the state art museums there as a stagiaire. In Berlin, Swarzenski kept abreast of all the arts, becoming acquainted with the Bauhaus and BrĚ_cke masters Mies van der Rohe, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, Gerhard Marcks and Andreas Feininger. In 1936 he published his major work, <u>Die lateinischen illuminierten Handschriften des XIII. Jahrhunderts</u>. He used the modest honorarium he was paid for the book to buy a Beckmann painting. He left Nazi-controlled Germany in 1938--although a Protestant Christian he was from a Jewish background--accepting an offer to assist Erwin Panofsky (q.v.) at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. His father resigned and followed a short while later. At the Institute, Swarzenski published his book on the Berthold Missal. He became acting curator of sculpture at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC in 1943 (many museum personnel were in the war). Upon their return in 1946 he lost his position. In 1948 he was offered a position as a Research fellow in Medieval art at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, where his father also held that status. In 1948 year he wrote a forward to a catalog on his friend, Beckmann, in the first American retrospective of his art in St. Louis, MO. Between 1950-1956 he periodically lectured at the Warburg Institute in London. He married Brigitte Horney, an actress, in 1953. The same year he published his important <u>Monuments of Romanesque Art</u>, still a handbook for the period. He succeeded his father as Curator of Decorative Arts and Sculpture in the Museum in 1956, appointed by director Perry Rathbone (q.v.), whom he had known since Rathbone's days in St. Louis. Among Swarzenski's acquisitions during the Boston years were two works rejected as forgeries by other museums, the Lombard Virgin and Child, acquired in 1959, and an Ile-de-France Virgin and Child, both ca. 1200. In the early 1960s, Swarzenski identified a large 12th-century ivory cross offered to the Museum by a private seller. When he and Rathbone determined the Museum could not afford the treasure, it was referred to the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Thomas Hoving (q.v.) who ultimately acquired it as the (now famous) Cloister's Cross. Hoving neglected to mention in his memoirs Swarzenski's contribution. As a curator for all European sculpture, Swarzenski also purchased works by Giacometti, Calder, Brancusi and Henry Moore for the Museum. A 1972 festschrift contained artwork commissioned by both Beckmann and Calder. In 1973 he retired to a home in Wilzhofen, Oberbayern, Germany, where he died in 1985. Swarzenski's <u>Monuments of Romanesque Art</u> remains a characteristic work. It lacks extensive comment on the objects in favor of allowing the works to speak for themselves. Walter Cahn (q.v.) speculated that Swarzensky was equally uncomfortably with public oratory. A trained connoisseur in the postivistic vein of Goldschmidt, Swarzenski remained a true art historian rather than like so many German medievalists, an iconographer. His personal art collection, which, in addition to Beckmann, extended to Paul Klee and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, was made possible by art dealers who sold him these works modestly in exchange for Museum patronage of medieval works (Rathbone).",Germany;USA,"McClintock, Kathryn.

2142,"Tietze-Conrat, Erica",20 June 1883,"Vienna, Austria",12-Dec-58,"New York, NY, USA","Historian of Renaissance and Baroque art; wife of art historian Hans Tietze (q.v.). Conrat was the daughter of Hugo Conrat, a wealthy Viennese businessman with an enormous passion for music. Brahms was a dinner guest during Conrat's childhood and versions of her father's poetry Brahms set to music (<u>Zigeunerlieder</u>, opus 103). She attended the Institut Hanausek until age twelve and then the new MĚ_dchenschule gymnasium, graduating in 1901. She attended the University of Vienna between 1902-1905 where she met a young art history graduate student, <a href=""/tietzeh"">Hans Tietze</a>, both students of the first ""Vienna school"" art historian <a href=""/wickhofff"">Franz Wickhoff</a>. She wrote and published her dissertation under Wickhoff in 1905 on Austrian baroque sculptor Georg Raphael Donner (1693-1741), only the second woman to be graduated in art history during Wickhoff's tenure. Conrat married Tietze in December of 1905, the same year as her first published article. As Europe lacked any significant teaching positions for women then, Tietze-Conrat assisted her husband in his first position as an investigator for the commission on preservation of Austrian monuments (Zentralkommision fĚ_r Denkmalpflege). The Tietzes had four children between 1908 and 1918. Her husband served in the Austrian army from 1914, his duties still connected with the preservation of monuments, only now in north Italy. The Tietzes were first and foremost a research team. The Tietzes left the raising of thier children to a trusted nanny (who lived with the family until age 90). Both from well-to-do families, the art historian husband/wife team saw as part of their mission the support of contemporary art in Vienna as well as its historical research. Oskar Kokoschka was commissioned to paint a portrait of the two in 1909 (today, Museum of Modern Art, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Fund, 651.39). Together they helped organize the Vienna Society for the Advancement of Contemporary Art (Gesellschaft zur FĚ¦rderung der modernen Kunst in Wien) in 1920. As art historians, the Tietzes worked closely together, their desks pushed facing each other in order to facilitate discussion. Each, however, continued to publish separately as well as together. Hans Tietze made guest lectures to the United States in 1932 and 1935, Erica joining him on the second journey. The discovery of a large amount of material in the Uffizi on Venetian drawings by Erica Tietze-Conrat gave her the idea to publish a catalog of drawings from the Republic. From 1935 onward they traveled with that thought in mind. When the <i>Anschluss</i> came in 1938, Tietze-Conrat was in Italy, unaware of the situation. Her husband escaped Austria (both were from Jewish-extraction families) and met her in Italy. After word that their grown children were safe, the couple continued their research, visiting museums in the Netherlands and Paris. In 1939 they emigrated to the United States, leaving their housekeeper to watch over their Austrian home throughout the war. Hans Tietze taught for a single year as a Carnegie Professor at the Toledo Museum of Art before the couple moved to New York. During these financially difficult times, they sold their Kokoschka and joined the large cultural expatriate community there. They became American citizens in 1944. Hans never found an academic appointment in America, his only income coming from occasional assignments from the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the National Gallery of Art, Washington. When Columbia University offered him a course on Venetian art in the spring semester of 1954, Tietze, who was dying of cancer, was too ill to finish the class. Erica completed the lectures and was subsequently asked to lecture at Columbia again in 1955 and 1956. This was her only academic position as well. Her strong convictions to art remained. As a young Ph.D. candidate from Princeton, <a href=""/hovingt"">Thomas Hoving</a> recalled Tietze Conrat's intimidating shouts of ""You--Are--Wrong!"" at graduate student symposia at the Frick Collection (McPhee). In 1955 she published a monograph on Mantegna and two years later, <u>Dwarfs and Jesters in Art</u>. In 1970 a room in the ĚĐsterreichisches Barockmuseum, Lower Belvedere, was named in her honor for having revived the study of neglected Austrian masters such as Donner. Both Tietze-Conrat and her husband are noted for their compilation of fastidious catalogs. The three-volume critical catalog of Albrecht DĚ_rer (1928-38) contains all the categories of a modern evaluative <em>catalogue raisonnĚ©</em>. Many of the articles both published were the result of their research in catalog compilation. Their second combined achievement, a critical catalog of Venetian drawings (1944), required that they examine a relatively untouched area of Italian works on paper. Unlike Roman or Florentine, Venetian drawings were relatively unstudied. Savvy enough to understand that students often copied master drawings, they used carefully developed standards to authenticate autograph pieces. Some of their findings and attributions have not borne the test of time, particularly their assertion that the ""Sketchbooks of Jacopo Bellini"" represent many artists work over a range of years.",Austria;USA,"Kleinbauer, W.

2143,"Tietze, Hans",01 May 1880,"Prague, Czechoslovakia; [present day Czech Rebuplic], moder Czech Republic",4-Apr-54,"New York, NY, USA","""Vienna School""-trained historian of Venetian art; author of a major ""principles of art history"" monograph and developer of Baroque Museum, Vienna. Tietze was the son of a Czech lawyer, Siegfried Tietze (d. 1920), and Auguste Pohl. The family name had originally been Taussig. He attended the Gymnasium Altstadt in Prague. His father converted the family from Judaism to protestant Christianity in 1893 moving the family to Vienna. Tietze graduated from the Schottengymnasium there in 1898. Anxious to be seen as fully Austrian, he volunteered for a year's service in the Austrian army 1899-1900. Following discharge he entered the university in Vienna studying archaeology and history and art history between 1900-1903. Vienna's art history program was in the midst of solidifying its famous ""Vienna School"" methodology and Tietze studied with the masters including <a href=""/riegla"">Alois Riegl</a>, <a href=""/schlosserj"">Julius von Schlosser</a> and <a href=""/wickhofff"">Franz Wickhoff</a>. He wrote his dissertation under Wickhoff on the topic of medieval typological representation, awarded his degree in 1903. His article on Francesco de Hollanda was termed by Schlosser ""an exemplary piece of research"" (Held). In 1905 he married fellow Vienna art-history student <a href=""/tietzee"">Erika Conrat</a> who hailed from a prominent and cultural Viennese family. Tietze wrote his <em>habilitation</em> (also under Wickhoff) on the topic of Anibale Caracci's frescos at the Palazzo Farnese, accepted in 1905. Study of baroque artists was still rare in academic art history, the period generally considered degenerate. Tietze worked as Wickhoff's assistant holding an <i>ad personam</i> chair in the Erstes Kunsthistorisches Institut of <a href=""/strzygowski"">Josef Strzygowski</a>. The Tietzes raised their four children largely with a governness so as to be able to devote their energies to art. He became an assisant at the Commission for Monument Preseveration (Zentralkommission fĚ_r Denkmalplege), rising to secretary of the Commision in 1909. Headng a relatively small staff, he oversaw an inventory of monuments ultimately comprising thirteen volumes, <u>ĚĐsterreichische Kunsttopographie</u>. In 1909, too, he was accepted as a <em>Privatdozent</em> at the University. Tietze and his wife enthusiastically supported modern art, commissioning the twenty-three-year-old expressionist paingter Oskar Kokoschka to paint their marriage portrait in 1909. When World War I broke out, he mobilized into the army again intially seeing action but later as an officer assigned to art protection in Italy (1914-1918). At the war's conclusion--disastrous for Austria--he, as a negotiator for war reparations of Austrian art, skillfully kept Austria's heritage intact (Buschbeck). Afterward, Tietze received an <em>ausserordentlicher</em> (assistant) professor appointment at Vienna and began editing the periodical <u>Die bildenden KĚ_nste</u>. The next year Tietze submitted a proposal for the reorganization of Austrian museums and was appointed by Emil FĚ¦rster-Streffleur to the art section of the Austrian government's instruction initiatvie (Ě¦sterreichische Staatsamt fĚ_r Unterricht). In 1920, too, the Tietzes consolidated their position as major public exponents of modern art by joining the Association for the Promotion of Modern Art in Vienna (Gesellschaft zur FĚ¦derung der modernen Kunst in Wien). Beginning in 1923, Tietze reorganized the art museum system in Vienna from its imperial arrangement to one more reflecting the popular and pedagogical direction of the new federal goverment, integrating the Hapsburg collections into existing museums. This included combining of the print collection of the Hofbibliothek into the Albertina collection and the creation of the Belvedere galleries: the baroque museum in the Lower Belvedere, the 19th-century museum in the Upper Belvedere and the modern (20th-century) art museum in the Orangerie. He worked at this successfully until 1925 when he resigned over bureaucratic frustrations. He continued as a private teacher with a titular appointment to the University with a new outlook toward art--to portray art and artists as fully real players in history and not simply producers of art (Gombrich, 1954), writing radio broadcasts on art. His knowlege of modern art and respect as a scholar allowed him to continue to advise Austrian museums on purchase of late-19th-century (""Post-Impressionist) art. He embarked on a new assessment of Albrecht DĚ_rer, joined by Erica. Volume one, <u>Der junge DĚ_rer</u>, appeared in 1928, a ground-breaking work for its integration of all DĚ_rer media and its ""ruthless rejection of many traditional and recent attributions"" (Gombrich, 1954). It was the new approach to DĚ_rer that led him to study Venentian art, a favorite of his mentor, Wickhoff. Tietze made guest lectures to the United States in 1932 and 1935. The text for a catalog on Venetian renaissance drawings by the the pair was completed 1935 but remained unpublished until the English edition of 1944. A monograph on Titian was issued in 1936. The annexation of Austria by the Nazis in 1938 resulted in Tietze's <em>non-grata</em> status as a pacificist and of ""non-Arian"" background. While traveling in Italy, the Tietzes were forbidden to return and their home plundered. The couple fled to London and then the United States leaving their apartment in the hands of their housekeeper. Tietze secured an appointment as a visiting professor at the Toledo Museum of Art under a Carnegie Foundation support for 1938-1939. The following year the couple settled in New York city, sold their Kokoschka to the Museum of Modern Art (1939) living as private scholars. Tietze wrote introductions to European art catalogs for various regional American museums, lighter books for a general public (""great art"" surveys and a book on forgeries) and continued his steady stream of scholarly aricles. He secured occasional assignments from the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC. He lectured at Columbia University on Venetian painting in the spring semester of 1954, but, already ill with cancer, was too ill to finish the class. The course was completed by Erica. He was cremated and his ashes buried under a tree at their summer home in New Boston, MA. Students greatly influenced by his teaching in Vienna included <a href=""/gombriche"">Ernst H. Gombrich</a> and <a href=""/kurzo"">Otto Kurz.</a> Tietze's <em>Geistesgeschichte</em> approach to art history--most clearly seen in the DĚ_rer catalogs--a view of an artist as a living personality and not as an evolution of styles--was directly inherited from his Vienna School training. He was fascinated by neglected periods and genres; his early research into the Bolognese Anibale Carracci perhaps influenced the younger Kurz to write his dissertation on the (still unfashionable) baroque artist Guido Reni. The Tietzes as a scholarly couple divided their work between Hans, the theorist and actual writer of the texts and Erica who provided the details (Held). E. H. Gombrich characterized Tietze's <u>Methode der Kunstgeschichte</u> as, in addition to displaying Tietze's learning, betraying the inner crisis of art history: what, in fact, the goal of the art historian should be (Gombrich, 1954). Both Tietzes were intense driving personalities, a fact remarked upon by friends and adversaries alike. Kokoschka described his sitters as ""closed personalities so full of tension"" (MoMA). Julius Held, in a saludatory obituary, characterized Tietze as ""uncompromising"" and ""strong willed."" This assured, unbending nature proved a detriment as much as an advantage. Tietze, who had made such significant reforms in Austrian museum culture, found himself shut out of appointments in the American Art Museum world. His lack of admiration for connoisseurship as an end--a staple of art museology--brought distrust from museum directors. ""To identify connoisseurship with art history would be like confusing detection with jurisprudence,"" he remarked (Gombrich, 1954). The offense this caused can be seen in two reviews of Tietze books by the Art Institute of Chicago associate director <a href=""/maxonj"">John Maxon</a>, whose analysis appeared so vindictive that that Columbia scholar David Rosand (b. 1938) decried it in print as a personal vendetta by Maxon. Udo Kultermann characterized Tietze as ""one of the outstanding scholars both in the area of the art of the Renaissance and of the modern era.""",Austria;USA,"Jahn, Johannes, ed. <u>Die Kunstwissenschaft der Gegenwart in Selbstdarstellungen</u>.

2149,"Tolnay, Charles de",27 May 1899,"Budapest, Hungary",17-Jan-81,"Florence, Italy","Michelangelo scholar and Columbia University professor. Tolnay was the son of Arnold von Tolnai, an high-ranking official of the Hungarian administration of the Austro-Hungarian government. He graduated from the Staatsovergymnasium in Budapest, where he was raised, in 1918. Tolnay was a participant in the famous Budapest <em>Sonntagskreis</em> (Sunday Circle) whose members included intellectuals such as the philosopher Georg LukĚÁcs (1885-1971) and art historians <a href=""/hausera"">Arnold Hauser</a>, <a href=""/antalf"">Frederick Antal</a>, and <a href=""/wildej"">Johannes Wilde</a>. Beginning in 1918, Tolnay studied art history and archaeology in Berlin (under <a href=""/goldschmidta"">Adolph Goldschmidt</a>), in Frankfurt (under <a href=""/kautzschr"">Rudolf Kautzsch</a>) and Vienna, completing his dissertation in 1925 under the pre-eminent Vienna-School scholar <a href=""/schlosserj"">Julius Schlosser</a>. His dissertation topic was on Hieronymous Bosch. Methodologically, however, Tolnay was as much influenced by <a href=""/dvorakm"">Max Dvo�ŞĚÁk</a>, another of the Vienna scholars. He moved to Rome, researching the topic that would become his life's major focus, Michelangelo. In 1928 he became a privatdozent associated with the University of Hamburg, coming into contact with the young <a href=""/panofskye"">Erwin Panofsky</a> and writing his habilitation in 1929 on Michelangelo's late architecture. He married Rina Ada Clara Bartolucci in 1930. He received research grants from the Bibliotheca Hertziana for additional study in Rome. Tolnay objected to the Nazi's policies and, although not Jewish himself, he, along with many Jewish art historians, emigrated from Germany. He fled to Paris in 1933 where he worked as the ChargĚ© de ConfĚ©rences at the Institut d'art et d'archĚ©ologie of the Sorbonne. Tolnay's 1939 book on the Master of FlĚ©malle, written in French during this period, established the now accepted notion that this artist is the same as the artist Robert Campin and likely the artist Jacques Daret. With Panofsky's written recommendation on his behalf, he immigrated to the United States in 1939, working at a member of the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, NJ, until 1948. During this time he issued the first of what would become his five-volume analysis on the work of Michelangelo, <u>The Youth of Michelangelo</u>. He become a U.S. citizen as well. After a Guggenheim Fellowship for 1948-1949, he was named a Bollingen Fellow from 1949 until 1953. In 1953 Tolnay was appointed professor at Columbia University. He completed his Michelangelo series in 1960. Tolnay retired from Columbia in 1965 to become Director of the Casa Buonarotti in Florence. As director, he presided over the museum's rescue and restoration of the artworks damaged during the disastrous 1966 flood of the Arno river. He also reorganized the object numbering system and mounted several high-profile exhibitions. Tolnay married second time, to Anna-Marie Reps, a writer and painter, in 1971. During the final years of his life, he began issuing a corpus of Michelangelo drawings, <u>Corpus dei disegni di Michelangelo</u>, the first volume of which appeared in 1975. He died at age 82 in Florence. In 1934, Panofsky wrote that Tolnay was ""one of the most brilliant art historians"" of their time (Wendland). As a connoisseur, Tolnay's attributions convinced the great Berlin scholar <a href=""/friedlanderm"">Max J. FriedlĚ_nder</a> that some of FriedlĚ_nder's own attributions had been wrong. As a modernist, Tolnay he followed the theory of FĚ_lep (whom he acknowledged) in an essay on CĚ©zanne Tolnay published in Hungarian in 1924, arguing that CĚ©zanne's importance was his technique of representing the fragmented world of modernity through his brushstrokes, ""which embodies the essence of form."" (LackĚ_). Tolnay was able to combine two disparate methodologies of his mentors, Goldschmidt and Dvo�ŞĚÁk, into a cohesive approach, respecting both the object and a theoretical framework on which to place it (Salvini). His major work on Michelangelo was eminently readable, but suffered, according to some, from Tolnay's lack of contact with the original sources. His legacy was continued by the work of <a href=""/ackermanj"">James Ackerman</a> (Lein).",Germany;USA;Italy,"Kleinbauer, W.

Vogel was raised in Stettin, Germany where his father was a local merchant. After graduating from the humanistisches Gymnasium in Stettin in 1916, he entered the army in World War I where he was severely wounded. Upon recuperation in 1919 he studied political science, earning his first Ph.D. in 1923 from the university in Vienna. He entered studied thereafter in art history, attending lectures at Marburg under Richard Hamann (q.v.) and then Leipzig under Wilhelm Pinder (q.v.). His dissertation, written under Pinder, was on architects of Stettin in the eighteenth century. He volunteered at the Kunstgewerbemuseum (Arts and Crafts Museum) in Leipzig beginning in 1926. He married Suzanne Neië_er around this time. He worked for the publisher Brockhaus as an art editor briefly before being appointed an assistant at the city museum of Halle an der Saale in 1928. The following year he became an art history Dozent at the art academy in Kassel (Staatliche Kunstakademie Kassel). When the academy closed in 1932, he move to an unpaid curatorial assistant at the art museum there. Vogel's wife, because of her Jewish background, was declared a ""non-Aryan"" by the Nazis. He secured a grant to inventory the building and art of the Hohenzollern in Sigmaringen. This led to a 1936 project cataloging the print and book collection for Prince Friedrich Heinrich von Preussen in Kamenz in Schlesien, ultimately charged to liquidate some of the assets. At the end of War, Vogel was hounded by the Gestapo for his ""mixed marriage"" status to a Jew. After the War he was appointed director of the art museum at Kassel, 1946. An industrial city, Kassel suffered heavy bombing by allied forces and the museum building was heavily damaged. Vogel spent those years rebuilding the collection,the heavily damaged museum building was accomplished after his tenure. He oversaw the issuing of a catalog in 1958. He retired in 1962.

Volbach's father was Friedrich (""Fritz"") Volbach, a professor and orchestra conductor. The younger Volbach attended school in Mainz and Bensheim, receiving his <em>abitur</em> in 1911. After graduation, he volunteered at the RĚ¦misch-Germanisches Zentralmusem (Roman antiquities museum) in Mainz 1911 and 1915. He further volunteered at the Landesmuseum in Wiesbaden, reinstalling the collection when the director was killed in World War I. During this same period, Volbach studied archaeology, art history and medieval history at the universities of Munich, Berlin (under <a href=""/goldschmidta"">Adolph Goldschmidt</a>), TĚ_bingen (under <a href=""/langek"">Konrad von Lange</a>) and finally GieĚŮen (Giessen) under <a href=""/rauchc"">Christian Rauch</a>. He wrote his dissertation in 1916 under Rauch at Giessen on the topic of the figure of St. George in medieval German art. The Kaiser-Friedrich Museum director <a href=""/bodew"">Wilhelm Bode</a> hired him for his museum in 1917. With <a href=""/vitzthumg"">Count Georg von Vitzthum</a> he authored the <u>Handbuch der Kunstwissenschaft</u> volume on Italian medieval art. At the Museum he collaborated with Ernst F. Bange (1893-?) and Theodor Demmler on the catalog for the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin. During this time he became a founding member and lecturer at the Volkshochschule in Berlin. Volbach was interested in the contemporary art scene in Berlin and knew many of <em>Die BrĚ_cke</em> German Expressionists. He married Maria Luise Adelung (d. 1936) in 1928.

2289,"Weitzmann, Kurt",1904,"Klein Almerode, Germany; [near Kassel]",1993,"Princeton, NJ, USA","Princeton scholar, influential Byzantinist and medievalist. Weitzman was the son of Wilhelm Weitzman, a city school superintendent, and Antoine Keiper. Weitzmann initially attended courses in the dominant art historical periods of that time, ancient and renaissance art at the universities of MĚ_nster, WĚ_rzburg and Vienna. His professors included the eminent of that time: <a href=""/wackernagelm"">Martin Wackernagel</a>, <a href=""/salisa"">Arnold von Salis</a>, the theologian Adolf von Harnack (1851-1930), and Vienna-School giants <a href=""/schlosserj"">Julius von Schlosser</a>, <a href=""/strzygowski"">Josef Strzygowski</a>, <a href=""/swobodak"">Karl Maria Swoboda</a>, and <a href=""/lowye"">Emanuel LĚ¦wy</a>. Weitzmann completed his education in Berlin under the distinguished archaeological art historian <a href=""/noackf"">Ferdinand Noack</a> and the eminent medievalist art historian <a href=""/goldschmidta"">Adolph Goldschmidt</a>. Goldschmidt directed Weitzmann's 1929 dissertation on ivory rosette caskets, <u>Die ElfenbeinkĚ_sten aus der mittelbyzantinsichen Zeit</u>, which he and Weitzmann published as the first volume of Goldschmidt's corpus of medieval ivories, <u>Die byzantinischen Elfenbeinskulpturen des X.-XIII. Jahrhunderts</u>. Weitzmann collaborated on the second volume of the series as well as his <i>Habilitation</i> under Goldschmidt. During these years Weitzmann was a member of the Deutsches ArchĚ_ologischen Institut in Berlin (1930-1934), using a stipend from that body for research in Athens, Patmos and Mount Athos (1931) and Berlin (1932-1934). In 1932 he married fellow Goldschmidt student Josepha Fiedler (1904-2000). Although not Jewish himself, his association with Goldschmidt, a Jew, and his refusal to join the Nazi party in order to teach as a <i>Dozent</i> at the University mandated his leaving Germany. He left Berlin for Princeton University in 1935, where he remained the rest of his life teaching and writing. His wife followed in 1938. At Princeton, he was a permanent member of the Institute for Advanced Study, initially engaged in preparing a corpus of illustrated manuscripts of the Septuagint with <a href=""/moreyc"">Charles Rufus Morey</a> and <a href=""/frienda"">Albert M. Friend, Jr.</a>. In 1938 he began his long association with Dumbarton Oaks, Harvard's research center for Byzantine studies, presenting the paper, ""Principals of Byzantine Book Illumination,"" even before the center was fully established. In 1945, he succeeded Morey as professor in the department of art history. He and Friend conducted a manuscript seminar until Weitzmann's retirement. His most influential book, <u>Illustrations in Roll and Codex</u>, a distillation of his principles of manuscript interpretation, appeared in 1947 (later revised and reissued in 1970). He held visiting positions at Yale (1954-55). In 1956 he began his long research association with the Monastery of St. Catherine on Mt. Sinai. On his first visit he examined and photographed 2,000 manuscripts. Subsequent visits were sponsored by the Alexandria-Michigan-Princeton Expedition directed by <a href=""/forsythg"">George Forsyth</a>. In 1960 he was visiting professor at Alexandria University. Weitzmann presented a manuscript seminar at the UniversitĚ_t Bonn in 1962. Together with <a href=""/kitzingere"">Ernst Kitzinger</a> he organized the 1965 Dumbarton Oaks conference on Byzantine contribution to the art of the West of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. A second edition of his <u>Illustrations in Roll and Codex</u> appeared in 1970. Named emeritus in the department in 1972, he relinquished his Institute appointment to be a visiting scholar at Dumbarton Oaks, 1972-1974. In 1977, Weitzmann organized an exhibition and symposium (with Margaret Frazer) at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, entitled, ""The Age of Spirituality."" The show recapped Weitzmann's originality in looking at the range of early medieval objects which both showed the unity of the objects and the adoption of pagen images into new meanings. Although the icons of St. Catherine's had been published in cursory form, Weitzmann's enthusiasm for them and the place they played in religious iconography resulted a longer treatment. With George Forsyth he issued <u>The Monastery of Saint Catherine on Mount Sinai</u>. volume one on <u>The Church and Fortress  of Justinian</u>, 1973 and a second volume of the Monastery, <u>The Icons</u>, 1976, the former a result of Weitzmann's supervission of the restoration of the Transfiguration mosaic of St. Catherine's. A book on <u>The Frescoes of the Dura Synagogue and Christian Art</u> co-authored with another of his students, <a href=""/kesslerh"">Herbert Kessler</a> appeared in 1990. That year, too, his research on illuminations of the St. Catherine's Monastery research began to appear in book form. The first, published in collaboration with another former student, <a href=""/galavarisg"">George Galavaris</a>, was <u>The Illuminated Greek Manuscripts from the Ninth to the Twelfth Century</u> His eyesight gone and his health failing rapidly in the spring of 1993, Weitzmann was conferred an honorary Doctor of Letters at bedside shortly before his death. Weitzmann was responsible for training many of the leading medievalists of the next generation. His students, in addition to Galavaris and Kessler, included Paul Underwood, <a href=""/martinj"">John Rupert Martin</a>, <a href=""/eitnerl"">Lorenz Eitner</a>, <a href=""/kochra"">Robert Koch</a>, <a href=""/hovingt"">Thomas Hoving</a>, <a href=""/grabaro"">Oleg Grabar</a>, <a href=""/snyderj"">James Snyder</a>, <a href=""/kelinbauerw"">W. Eugene Kleinbauer</a>, and Robert P. Bergman. <u>Roll and Codex</u> illustrates Weitzmann's brilliance and methodology. Through precise visual analysis and archaeological evidence, he traced an evolution of illustrated manuscripts in the early Christian and Byzantine era, theorizing two turning points, Egyptian ""papyrus style"" and Greek ""continuous narrative"" style. From these two types, Weitzmann created a method of interpreting extant illustrations. In a 1990 Dumbarton Oaks publication, <u>The Frescoes of the Dura Synagogue and Christian Art</u>, he argued effectively that Christian symbolism, rather than emerging from a slow progression on its own, developed from a Jewish tradition of images adopted from a classical vocabulary. His encounter with Crusader icons at St. Catherine's buttressed Weitzmann's conviction to study all of medieval art, which he did in numerous articles and lectures. His legacy to early medieval art was foremost not to see a rigid division between east and west.",Germany;USA,"[autobiography] <u>Sailing with Byzantium from Europ to America: The Memoirs of an Art Historian</u>.

2295,"Wescher, Hertha",1899,"Krefeld, Germany",3-Mar-71,"Paris, France","Scholar of modernist art, authority on collage, art critic. Kauert's parents were Heinrich Kauert, a merchant, and Maria Jentges (Kauert). She attended the Lyceum and was tutored privately, receiving her abitur in 1917 in Bonn. She immediately began studying art history, history and archaeology at the Universities of Heidelberg, Munich (under <a href=""/wolfflinh"">Heinrich WĚ¦lfflin</a>) and Freiburg. In Munich, she made close friendships with many who would become important art historians, including WĚ¦lfflin students <a href=""/rohf"">Franz Roh</a>, <a href=""/curjelh"">Hans Curjel</a>, <a href=""/giedions"">Siegried Giedion</a>, and <a href=""/giedionwelckerc"">Carola [Giedion-]Welcker</a>. This group--all modern art enthusiasts--instilled a passion for modern art in her as well. At Freiburg Kauert studied under <a href=""/jantzenh"">Hans Jantzen</a>. She met and married the Jantzen student <a href=""/wescherp"">Paul Wescher</a> in 1923, adopting his surname professionally. She received her Ph.D. in Freiburg (almost certainly under Jantzen) in 1924, writing her dissertation on the 16th-century painter Sebastian Dayg. After graduation, her husband secured a position at the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (State Museum in Berlin) and she volunteered at the graphics division there as well, working under <a href=""/friedlanderm"">Max FriedlĚ_nder</a>. Through FriedlĚ_nder she secured a position with the scholar assembling the Peter Paul Rubens <i>catalogue raisonn</i><i>Ě©</i>, <a href=""/burchardl"">Ludwig Burchard</a>. Wescher became involved in the comtemporary art scene in Berlin, both through Roh, <a href=""/glaserc"">Curt Glaser</a>, Curjel and the artist LĚÁszlĚ_ Moholy-Nagy. Strong supporters of the Weimar Republic and the Bauhaus school of architecture, she and her husband's views were directly opposed to the conservative art ideology of national socialism. With the accession to power of Hitler in 1933 the couple moved to Paris. Wescher worked as a journalist and, between 1936-1937, as a correspondent for the English art magazine <u>Axis</u>. She helped organize the Freier KĚ_nstlerbund, among whose members were the art historians Sabine Spiro and <a href=""/westheimp"">Paul Westheim</a>. With France's entrance into World War II, she was interned in 1940. She and her husband fled to Switzerland in 1942, settling in Basle. At the conclusion of the war, she separated from her husband, returning to Paris in 1945. Wescher wrote freelance articles and in the early 1950s for <u>Art d'Aujourd'hui</u>. In 1953 she helped found the journal <u>Cimaise</u>. Among her topics at this time were collage. Wescher wrote a major monograph on the art form in 1968, <u>Die Collage</u>. She died of a heart attack at age 72. .Wescher's career eclipsed that of her husband's, prinicipally through her specialty in the relatively unpublished area of collage. She became an authority on it and an early exponent of non-figurative art. The New York Times termed her book on collage ""a definitive summing up on that major technique in [the] 20th century.""

Paul Getty Museum, 1953-1959. Wescher was the son of Paul Wescher, M.D., and Elsa Mez (Wescher). He attended a humanites Gymnasium in Freiburg, volunteering for World War I (fighting in field artillery) where he received his abitur in 1918. After the war studied art history, archaeology and literature in Freiburg and Munich beginning in 1919. Wescher studied under the major art historians of the time, including <a href=""/wolfflinh"">Heinrich WĚ¦lfflin</a>, <a href=""/franklp"">Paul Frankl</a> and <a href=""/mayera"">August L. Mayer</a>, in Munich and then at Freibrug under <a href=""/friedlanderw"">Walter FriedlĚ_nder</a> and <a href=""/jantzenh"">Hans Jantzen</a>. He completed his dissertation under Jantzen in 1923 writing on an aspect of manuscript illumination before the fourteenth century. The same year he married a fellow art historian <a href=""/wescherh"">Hertha Kauert [Wescher]</a>. Wescher initially worked as a volunteer at the Augustiner-Museum in Freiburg, 1919-1921 before securing a job as a curatorial assistant at the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (State Museum in Berlin), 1924-1927, where his wife also volunteered. In 1927 he was appointed to the graphics collection cataloging Flemmish drawings, publishing a catalog, <u>Beschreibendes Verzeichnis der Miniaturen Handschriften</u> in 1931. His strong objection to Hitler's rise to power in 1933 resulted in his leaving Germany on political grounds in 1934, moving to Paris. There he researched and worked as an art dealer through 1939. He moved to Campione am Lugano, Switzerland that year as a private scholar and teacher, writing books (most notibly, one on Renaissance Merchants) and as a commissioned author for the Basel publisher Holbein-Verlag. The couple divorced around this time. He published a major monograph on the French Renaissance painter Jean Fouquet, <u>Jean Fouquet und seine Zeit</u> in 1945. After the war, Wescher's career would be inextricably connected to his friend, the former Detroit Institute of Art director <a href=""/valentinerw"">Wilhelm (William) Valentiner</a>. Valentiner had the Detroit Institute of Arts hire Wescher as a research associate at the Museum and Wescher immigrated to the United States in 1948. Wescher followed Valentiner as an assistant to Valentiner's postions at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. There, Wescher was picked in 1953 to be the director of the art collection the Oklahoma billionaire J. Paul Getty (1892-1976) was assembling in Santa Monica, CA. The collection at that time amounted to mostly second-rate baroque artists because of Getty's unwillingness to pay high prices for art, but a spectacular collection of French decorative art. He remarried again (Mary Wescher). He resigned from the Getty in 1959, working as a private researcher, curating exhibitions in the U.S., most notably, at the North Carolina Museum of Art under <a href=""/byrnesj"">James B. Byrnes</a> (where Valentiner had been its first director) and at the New Orleans Museum of Art. He died at his California home in 1974. His research on the art-thefts of Napoleon was published posthumously in 1976.  Wescher was a scholar of Flemmish art though his principle book publication were in other areas. His book on Jean Fouquet was termed definitive by the <u>Burlington Magazine</u>. He was among the generation of ""discovery art historians,"" whose numbers included <a href=""/bodew"">Wilhelm Bode</a>, <a href=""/friedlanderm"">Max FriedlĚ_nder</a>, and <a href=""/winklerf"">Friedrich Winkler</a>, scholars who through stylistic analysis compiled oeuvre catalogs of artists establishing a body of work (Otten).",Germany;USA,"Otten, Frank.

Wichert attended various gymnasiums in Prussian cities where his father, Friedrich Wichert, was stationed as an officer in the Prussian military, together with his mother was Fanny Klumpp (Wichert). After receiving an <em>abitur</em> from the Wiesbaden Realgymnasium in 1899, studied art history and Philosophy at Freiburg, Basel (under Heinrich A. Schmid, q.v.), Berlin and eventually again at the Albert-Ludwigs-UniversitĚ_t, Freiburg, where he was awarded his Ph.D. in 1907. His dissertation, written under Heinrich WĚ¦lfflin (q.v.), was on the topic of representation in medieval Italian art. Wichert joined the StĚ_dtische Galerie under its director, Georg Swarzenski (q.v.). He married a Dutch woman, Margarete Brouwer (d. 1921) in 1908. Wichert contributed reviews to the <u>Frankfurter Zeitung</u> as well. In 1909 he became director of the Kunsthalle in Mannheim, Germany where he set about purchasing French and German art of the 19th and 20th century. Among his famous purchases was the Manet painting ""The Execution of Maximilian."" He hired the young Gustav Hartlaub (q.v.) as a curator in 1913. The two mounted many epoch-making exhibitions of modern art and founding an association for art (Freien Bundes zur EinbĚ_rgerung der Bildenden Kunst). After the death of his first wife, he married a woman of English/Jewish extraction, Margarete Wetzlar-Coit in 1922. The following year he was called to be director of the StĚ_delschule in Frankfurt, the art school for the StĚ_delsches Kunstinstitut, succeeded at Mannheim by Hartlaub. Wichert transformed the school into the most important arts-and-crafts technical school in Germany (Wendland). Between 1924 and 1930 he was involved with historic preservation for Wiesbaden. With the Nazi's rise to power in Germany in 1933, Wichert was denounced as a Bolshevik sympathizer for his modern art preferences. Pressures because of his wife's Jewish background (her father was a baptized British Jew) forced her and his daughter to flee to England. Wichert allowed her to divorce him and assume the name Wickham in order to spare them anti-German prejudice. Wichert himself retired to Keiten auf Sylt in 1934.

His parents were Richard Wilde (1840-1912) and Rosalie SomjĚÁgy (Wilde) (1854-1928). He attended the State Gymnasium in Budapest before the University of Budapest, 1909-1913 where he studied art, archaeology and philosophy, then one semester at the University of Freiburg before settling at the University of Vienna, 1915-1917. In Vienna he studied under Vienna-school scholar <a href=""/dvorakm"">Max Dvo�ŞĚÁk</a>, with whom he wrote his doctorate in 1918 on early Italian etching. Since 1914 he had been a volunteer at the department of prints at the Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest. In 1918 he was promoted to Assistant Curator at the Museum. There he was a member of the so-called Budapest Sunday Circle (Budapester Sonntagskreis) whose members included <a href=""/antalf"">Fredrick Antal</a>, <a href=""/hausera"">Arnold Hauser</a> and <a href=""/tolnayc"">Charles de Tolnay</a>. In 1922 he moved permanently to Vienna where he was an assistant at the GemĚ_ldegalerie of the Kunsthistorischen Museums, under the direction of the talented <a href=""/gluckg"">Gustav GlĚ_ck</a>. In Vienna he collaborated with <a href=""/swobodak"">Karl Maria Swoboda</a> in editing the collected works of Dvo�ŞĚÁk. In 1923 he became Assistant Keeper, then Keeper of the GemĚ_ldegalerie, where he was an early exponent of the use of x-rays for painting conservation. He became an Austrian citizen in 1928. In 1930 Wilde married the art historian Julia GyĚÁrfĚÁs (d. 1970). Although Wilde was Roman Catholic, his Jewish wife was in jeopardy when the Nazis rose to power in 1933. The couple left for Holland in 1939 and then, as guests of <a href=""/clarkk"">Sir Kenneth Clark</a> went to Aberystwyth, Wales, to consult for his former student, <a href=""/seilerundaspanga"">Count Antoine Seilern und Aspang</a> on his collection. Wilde also assisted in cataloging the pictures of the National Gallery, where the London paintings were stored for safekeeping. Wilde was asked by the Keeper of Prints and Drawings <a href=""/pophama"">Arthur E. Popham</a> of the British Museum to write a catalog of old master drawings at Windsor Castle in 1939. When World War II broke out, the Wilde's were interned and deported to an alien camp in Canada for the years 1940-1941, erroneously charged with signaling enemy submarines. They returned to England in 1941 where Wilde resumed his work on the Windsor Castle catalog. At the same time he began lecturing at the Courtauld Institute. He became a Reader in the History of Art there in 1947. The following year he advanced to Deputy Director of the Courtauld Institute of Art which he held until 1958. He was professor of History of Art beginning in 1950. He became emeritus in 1958. His students included <a href=""/shearmanj"">John Shearman</a> and <a href=""/borsooke"">Eve Borsook</a>. Wilde published comparatively little and never allowed his lectures to be printed in his lifetime (his Michelangelo lectures appeared in 1978). Early on he was influenced by the work of the philosopher Wilhelm Dilthey (1833-1911), especially evident in Wilde's empirical approach to studying the object (Shearman). Wilde's scholarship on Michelangelo is some of his finest, his Windsor Castle collection catalog dispelled many myths about the artist. Wilde was an equal authority on Venetian art, a reputation he had already built during his years at the GemĚ_ldegalerie in Vienna. ",UK,"Clark, Kenneth.

2339,"Wind, Edgar",14 May 1900,"Berlin, Germany",12-Sep-71,"London, England, UK","Iconologist specializing in the Renaissance era; and interdisciplinary art historian; first professor of art history at Oxford University. Wind learned classical languages along with French, English, and his native German at the Kaiser-Friedrich-Schule, a <i>humanistisches Gymnasium</i> in Charlottenburg. He studied jointly philosophy and art history at various Germanic universities: three semesters in Berlin under <a href=""/goldschmidta"">Adolph Goldschmidt</a>, one in Freiburg with Edmund Husserl (1859-1938) and Martin Heidegger (1889-1976), and Vienna with <a href=""/dvorakm"">Max Dvo�ŞĚÁk</a>, <a href=""/schlosserj"">Julius von Schlosser</a>, and <a href=""/strzygowski"">Josef Strzygowski</a>. In 1920 he moved to the new university in Hamburg (begun in 1919) where he was the first student to write a dissertation under <a href=""/panofskye"">Erwin Panofsky</a>, then a 28-year-old <i>privatdozent</i>, and supervised by the philosopher/art historian <a href=""/cassirere"">Ernst Cassirer</a>. His topic was on art-historical method. To escape the economic depression gripping Germany, Wind traveled to New York in 1924, initially staying with a cousin. He was appointed Graham Kenan Fellow in philosophy at the University of North Carolina, teaching there 1925-1927. Returning to Hamburg, Wind took a job as a research assistant at the Warburg Library, and wrote his <i>habilitation</i> under Cassirer in philosophy, employing the philosophy of Charles Sanders Pierce (1839-1914), whose work he had read in America. Wind's initial methodological influence had been that of Cassirer through Panofsky, but his close personal relationship with <a href=""/warburga"">Aby Warburg</a> brought him nearer to the ""cultural history"" approach of Warburg as well as the work of Pierce. Wind became a <i>privatdozent</i> at Hamburg, 1930-1933. With the advent of Nazism in Germany, Wind, a Jew, played a key role in moving the Warburg library to London along with himself and, with <a href=""/wittkowerr"">Rudolf Wittkower</a>, founded the <u> Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institute</u> in 1937. Throughout the second World War, Wind taught at universities in the United States, (New York University, 1940-1942 and the University of Chicago, 1942-1944) and eleven years at Smith College, 1944-1955. In 1954 Wind was asked to deliver the Chichele Lectures at All Souls College, Oxford, on the topic ""Art and Scholarship under Julius II."" These resulted in a 1955 appointment as the first Professorship of art history at Oxford (under the Faculty of Modern History). In 1960 Wind delivered radio lectures for the BBC, the Reith lectures, which later became his book <u>Art and Anarchy</u>. His Oxford colleagues had difficulty appreciating Wind's philosophical propensities, his adulation of Cassierer and the post Hegelians (McConica). At Oxford he garnered the support of the classicist Richard Livingstone (1880-1960) (soon to be president of Corpus Christi College, Oxford) the medievalist Ernest Jacob (1894-1971), Chichele chair for medieval history All Souls College, and the classicist C. Maurice Bowra (1898-1971) of Wadham College. Wind also enjoyed the friendship of <a href=""/seznecj"">Jean Seznec</a>, an art historian occupying the Marshall Foch Chair for french literature at All Souls College. Wind retired emeritus from Oxford in 1967. Though Wind was considered a classicist and Renaissance expert, he staunchly defended modern art, unlike many of his colleagues. Wind's name is most closely connected with his research in allegory and the use of pagan mythology during the 15th-16th centuries and his book of essays on the topic, <u>Pagan Mysteries of the Renaissance</u>. In <u>Art and Anarchy</u>, Wind argued that the height of art's powers to portray an idea had occurred in the Renaissance. The Romantic era's distrust that knowledge interfered with imagination had destroyed the acumen in modern viewers. Wind fits no traditional academic classification and is one of the prime examples of the intellectual tradition of Warburg's blend of mythological/psychological approach to art history. One of his students, <a href=""/hecksherw"">William S. Heckscher</a>, referred to Wind as a ""magician"" for his brilliance as an art historian.

2350,"Wittkower, Rudi",22 June 1901,"Berlin, Germany",11-Oct-71,"New York, NY, USA","Scholar of Italian baroque art. Seminal figure for the generation of art historians who matured during the second half of the 20th century. Because Wittkower's father, Henry Wittkower (1865-1942), was British, the younger Wittkower held British citizenship his whole life despite having been born and raised in Germany. His mother was a German, Gertrude Ansbach (Wittkower) (1876-1965). After graduating from the humanistic Friedrichs Gymnasium in Berlin, Wittkower studied (practicing) architecture for a year in Berlin before deciding to changed to art history under <a href=""/wolfflinh"">Henrich WĚ¦lfflin</a> in Munich. WĚ¦lfflin proved to be a very detached professor, and, unhappy with his teaching, Wittkower returned to Berlin to study under <a href=""/goldschmidta"">Adolph Goldschmidt</a>. He completed his dissertation there on the subject of Domenico Morone. In 1923 he moved to Rome to assist <a href=""/steinmanne"">Ernst Steinmann</a>, director of the Herziana, with completion of the <u>Michelangelo-Bibliographie 1510-1926</u>. The same year he married Margot Holzmann (<a href=""/wittkowerm"">Margot Wittkower</a>) who was to assist him with some of his later scholarship. In between, Wittkower contributed many entries for artists in the <u>Allgemeines Lexikon der bildenden KĚ_nstler</u> (the so-called ""Thieme-Becker""). He was elevated at the Biblioteca Herziana to a research fellow, remaining there until 1927. Wittkower returned to Berlin but continued his association with the Herziana, publishing in 1931 with <a href=""/bauerh"">Heinrich Brauer</a> a survey of drawings by Bernini. The publication put him at the fore of an ideological battle (both esthetically and politically) with the major Austrian art historian, <a href=""/sedlmayrh"">Hans Sedlmayr</a>. Sedlmayr criticized Wittkower in a published review, for belonging to neither of the two genres of art history that Sedlmayr found acceptable. The public exchange drew a distinction between Sedlmayer's <i>Gestaltungsprinzipien</i> [abstract principles] approach to art history (as well as his anti-Jewish Nazi sympathies) and Wittkower's approach. After briefly teaching as a <em>Privatdozent</em> at the Univeristy in Cologne in 1932-1933, Wittkower was forced to leave Germany--now fully under the control of the Nazis, whose laws forbade university positions to Jews--abandoning any <em>habilitationschrift</em> for the London and the Warburg Institute. In London he was founding co-editor of the <u>Journal of the Warburg Institute</u> (renamed in 1940 to <u>The Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes</u>) in 1937, remaining at the Institute between 1934-1956. His position at the Institute allowed outside lecturing, such as his 1946 Courtauld Institute talks on the architecture of Vittone. Proof of his broad interests, when he first proposed the lectures to his host, <a href=""/blunta"">Anthony Blunt</a>, Blunt believed Wittkower joking and had invented the architect's name. In 1948 the young Italian scholar <a href=""/salernol"">Luigi Salerno</a> studied with Wittkower on a Warburg fellowship. Wittkower began publishing his research, first begun as his intended <em>habilitation</em> in the 1930s, on Palladio and Alberti, in <u>Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes</u>. These studies, expanded and broadened, were published in 1949 as his most significant book, <u>Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism</u>. Formal pedagogical duties also began that year when he was appointed to be Durning Lawrence professor at the Slade School of Art, although these were limited largely to advising dissertations. Wittkower's dedication to drawings as a scholarly tool continued. He collaborated with several other eminent art historians to produce books on Sir Robert Mond's collection (with <a href=""/boreniust"">Tancred Borenius</a>), drawings of Poussin (with Anthony Blunt, from a manuscript of <a href=""/friedlanderw"">Walter Friedlaender</a>). In 1952 he published a catalog of Carracci drawings from Windsor Castle. Wittkower was visiting professor of art history at Harvard University in 1954. This solidified a move to the United States, where he became chair of the Department of Art History and Archaeology at Columbia University in 1956. In addition to lecturing at Columbia, Wittkower reorganized the Department, adding, among appointments, the first lecturer in Near Eastern art. Here, too, he wrote two of his most popular books, <u>Art and Architecture in Italy: 1600-1750</u> (1958) and, in collaboration with his wife, <u>Born Under Saturn </u>(1963). <u>Art and Architecture in Italy</u>, volume 16 of the ""Pelican History of Art"" was (and remains) the publisher's best-selling volume of the series. A magisterial synthesis of a period of vast artistic output, Wittkower updated it three times. It received the Bannister Fletcher Prize for architectural writing. Wittkower retired from Columbia in 1969 as Avalon Foundation Professor Emeritus of Art History. During his final years, he held the Kress Professorship at the National Gallery of Art and Slade Professor at Cambridge. He delivered the Charles T. Mathews lectures for 1971-1972 which appeared as the book <u>Gothic vs. Classic: Architectural Projects in Seventeenth-century Italy</u>. After his death he received Alice Davis Hitchcock Award in 1975. He supervised many Ph.D. dissertations including <a href=""/seklere"">Eduard Sekler</a> (at the Warburg), <a href=""/pepperd"">D. Stephen Pepper</a> and <a href=""/rowec"">Colin Rowe</a>. Another student also became a colleague of his at Columbia university, <a href=""/hibbardh"">Howard Hibbard</a>, whose methodology Hibbard closely reflected. His scholarly tradition was most clearly continued in the work of <a href=""/connorsj"">Joseph Connors</a>. In terms of method, Wittkower certainly differed from Sedlmayr. Compared to Sedlmayr's psychological-theoretic approach of the same material, Wittkower, in the words of <a href=""/clarkk"">Kenneth Clark,</a> disposed of, ""the hedonist, or purely aesthetic, theory of Renaissance architecture."" Not that Wittkower eschewed psychology (two of his books used this approach principally) rather, he preferred to allow documents to connect psychological patterns he used rather than vice versa. Like Goldschmidt, he discounted the Hegelian view of art history so common among German art historians of his and previous generations. <a href=""/krautheimerr"">Richard Krautheimer</a> described Wittkower's art history as one blending mathematics and philosophy, the religious and cultural climate with the interrelations of patron and artist. Even the Warburg scholar <a href=""/saxlf"">Fritz Saxl</a>, who admitted in a 1934 letter that Wittkower's ideas on the history of art were much different from his own, concluded that Wittkower's ""struggle for clear-shaped logical notions in art history has undoubted merits."" <u>Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism</u> remains his most influential writing, having immediately influenced works as disparate as <u>Die Kunst der Renaissance in Italien</u> (1953) by <a href=""/paatzw"">Walter Paatz</a>, Ezra Ehrenkrantz's <u>The Modular Number Pattern</u> (1956) and P. H. Scholfield's The <u>Theory of Proportion in Architecture</u> (1958). The book, however caught the scorn of <a href=""/paner"">Roberto Pane</a> who attacked Wittkower's ideas at the Eighteenth International Congress of the History of Art (Venice) in 1956 (Wittkower, 1973). In 1961 Wittkower presented a paper at Winterthur, Delaware, on ""Art History as a Discipline"" which demonstrated his affinity for the work of <a href=""/panofskye"">Erwin Panofsky</a> and decrying the extreme connoisseurship of <a href=""/fryr"">Roger Fry</a>. The esthetician Joseph Masheck insightfully contrasted Panofsky with Wittkower, both fellow Warburg Institute scholars: ""Panofsky mainly pursued a history of illustrated concepts . . . that have taken roost . . . [in] datable objects."" Wittkower, on the other hand, he contended, is the ""ultra-Warburgian,"" not limited to the classical tradition but employing a cosmopolitan view of art.",Germany;UK;USA,"Kleinbauer, W.

2388,"Zeitler, Rudolf",28-Apr-12,"Cologne, Germany",Feburary 2005,"Uppsala, Sweden","University of Uppsala professor 1965-1977. Zeitler's parents were Eugen Zeitler (1880-1922), an engineer, and Elsa KĚ_hn (Zeitler) (1884-1922). Both parents were killed in a mountaineering accident in Berchtesgaden when Zeitler was ten; he was subsequently raised by his maternal grandfather in Kaiserslautern, Germany. He attended the Cologne and Kaiserslautern high schools (gymnasium) graduating in 1930. The same year he began study of history and art history in Munich, Marburg (under <a href=""/hamannr"">Richard Hamann</a>), and Berlin. Because his mother was a converted Jew, Zeitler was forced to flee Germany after Hitler's rise to power in 1933. He first fled to Czechoslovakia in that year continuing study in Prague. He was granted a Ph.D. in history from Prague in 1936, writing a dissertation on Sophicles and the polis under Victor Ehrenberg (1891-1976). In 1937, pending the annexation of that country to Germany, Zeitler moved to Sweden, teaching in the Gymnasium in Uppsala. Zeitler found a mentor in the Uppsala University art historian <a href=""/paulssong"">Gregor Paulsson</a>, publishing a monograph on Albrecht DĚ_rer in 1946. He married Hannelore GĚ_nthert (b. 1919), an historian, the following year. Zeitler published his habilitation, <u>Klassizismus und Utopia</u>, written under Paulsson, in 1954. He taught as a privatdozent until his appointment as professor at the University in 1964. Zeitler used his classical education write on the comparatively neglected area of nineteenth-century Neo-classicism. He edited <u>Figura</u> between 1965 and 1977. In 1966 he and Anders Ěäman published a ground-breaking volume on nineteenth-century art in the <u>PropylĚ_en Kunstgeschichte</u> series. Unlike many earlier surveys, it treated Neo-classicism as a significant art movement and not simply a dry precursor to Realism and Impressionism. He emphasized artistic theory of the era as a way to understand the art, an approach critized by some was ignoring truly popular taste. Zeitler eschewed the emerging post-war Warburg-school tradition of <a href=""/panofskye"">Erwin Panofsky</a> that used iconographical interpretation. Instead he approached the period as a characteristic, multinational expression of its particular time in history (Ěäman, <u>NZZ</u> 2005). Zeitler's most important book, <u>Klassizismus und Utopia</u>, emphasized Neo-classicism as the embodiment of significant bourgeois values, including utopian/dystopian views, which formed the basis for modern populist art. His rehabilitation of many neglected masterpieces of the years around 1800 marked an important revisionist approach to art history. His characterizing of the period as a dialectic, ""Kontrasterlebnis"" was adopted by other scholars of the nineteenth century, notably <a href=""/hofmannw"">Werner Hofmann</a>. He personally viewed his work as a continuation of the German-Jewish tradition of scholarship (Ěäman <u>NZZ</u> 2005).",Germany;Sweden,"Wendland, Ulrike. <u>Biographisches Handbuch deutschsprachiger Kunsthistoriker im Exil: Leben und Werk der unter dem Nationalsozialismus verfolgten und vertriebenen Wissenschaftler</u>.

Zucker's father, Julius Zucker, was a medical doctor who worked for the sanitation authority. His mother was Anna Samter (Zucker). The younger Zucker attended the Wilhelms-Gymnasium, a humanities high school in Berlin where he graduated in 1907. He studied architecture at the Institute of Technology (KĚ¦nigliche Technische Hochschule) receiving the Diplom-Ingenieur in 1911 and Doktor-Ingenieurs in 1913 in the history of architecture under Richard Borrmann (q.v.). His dissertation was on the topic of pictorial space in Florentine painting. Between 1912-14 he was an assistant to Max Georg Zimmermann (q.v.) at the Schinkel Museum. He married the concert singer Rose Walter (1890-1962) in 1913. After a year teaching at the Reimann Schule in Berlin, 1914, Zucker joined the faculty in art history as a lecturer (Dozent) at the Lessing Hochschule, 1916-35. He practiced architecture in Berlin between 1919-35, much of it as a city planner. He lectured on architecture in radio broadcasts. His interest in stage design led to his association with avant-garde theatre groups. Among his commissions were the Prussian Bank and many country homes. Zucker was Dean of the Faculty at the Lessing Hochschule, 1930-33. In 1937 he was dismissed from his position by the Nazis because he was a Jew. His journal articles of those last years were sign with initials only to avoid recognition. Zucker emigrated to the United States the same year began teaching at the New School for Social Research in New York, then known as the ""University in Exile."" He also lectured at the Fashion Institute, the Dramatic Workshop, and Pratt Institute, Brooklyn in the 1940s and 1950s. He remained at the New School until 1970. In 1938 he was appointed lecturer at the Cooper Union, then Adjunct Professor in 1948. He became an American citizen in 1944. In 1950 Zucker published his Styles in Art, a popular treatment of stylistic analysis in art. He retired in 1963 but retained Visiting Professor status 1964-1969 at the Cooper Union.
